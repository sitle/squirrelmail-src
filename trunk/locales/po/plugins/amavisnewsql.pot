"Here you may list the addresses you wish to protect and those you wish to "

"addresses so blacklisting these is pointless. The listed addresses appear in "

"section on priority to understand why this is important."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The priority determines the order of the list with the search stopping at "
"the first matching address.  Overlapping addresses should be listed from "
"specific to general.  E.g. if you want to allow one person from aol to mail "
"you and block everyone else you would use two rules. The higher priority one "
"set to whitelist friend@aol.com and a lower priority one set to blacklist "
"@aol.com. The server will match the specific higher priority address first "
"and end the search.  Addresses that are whitelisted for the whole company "
"appear above with the lowest priorities.. your settings can always override "
"the global ones."
