<sect>SquirrelMail overview
<p>
SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4. It includes 
built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render
in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across
browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and 
install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email 
client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder manipulation.

<em>Help, why am I getting this mail?</em>

Chances are you have been directed here for one of the following reasons.
<itemize>
  <item>You are receiving mail that has a header that looks like it was from SquirrelMail.
  <item>You are receiving MAILER-DAEMON errors reporting users don't exist, quoting headers showing SquirrelMail.
  <item>You are an ISP investigating spam levels.
</itemize>

If either of the above apply, chances are you have been caught in the latest
attempts at spam to fool anti-spam measures. A lot of spam has forged
headers. This means that they take pretend values, and substitute them to ill
effect. For example, replacing the From: address with your email address (or a
made up email). This can also apply to the other headers as well. This is
leading to cases of SquirrelMail being accused of sending spam, or our servers
being hacked. Rest assured, our servers are safe. In actual fact, we don't run
any servers at SquirrelMail.org. We do not even run mail services here, just
supplying our own software on a hosted service from 
<url url="http://sourceforge.net" name="SourceForge">.

So you may be wondering why all this mail is coming from us? Well to be honest
it isn't. Some people have developed software that pretends to be our software,
and is producing a lot of noise on the Internet containing such
information. This is leading people to think our software is unsafe, or is
acting as a spam service.

<em>So why am I getting these emails?</em>

Well the truth of the matter is that somebody guessed your email. This isn't
uncommon if you have email addresses like bob@myhost.com. The spammers just
randomly pick domains, and randomly generate emails from that domain to send
mail from. All we can suggest is you delete them, or contact the correct
authorities (usually your service provider should be able to help).

<em>So what are you doing to stop this?</em>

Unfortunately there isn't much we can do. Because spam is such a problem on the
Internet, the best thing we can do is educate people into the real facts. Below
are some basic ideas on how to detect where these forged emails are coming
from. While this isn't easy for most people, it gets easier with practise. There
is always your service provider, they should be able to help you.

<em>Okay, so what is the secret? How do I find out who is doing this?</em>

Honestly, you cannot find out the exactly person that is sending it, but you can
find out what the address (IP Address), and what service provider the mail was
sent via. Below is an example of the headers from a forged email: 

<tscreen><verb>
Return-path: <bob@example.com>
Received: from [123.123.123.123] (helo=randomdomainname.com)
   by example.com with smtp (Exim 3.36 #5)
   id 1D13zJ-0003mr-00
   for steve@example.net; Tue, 15 Feb 2005 14:47:42 +0000
Received: from 5.6.7.8
   (SquirrelMail authenticated user bob@example.com); by
   randomdomainname.com with HTTP; Tue, 15 Feb 2005 14:47:49 +0000
Message-Id: <6pr9Lv.squirrel@5.6.7.8>
Date: Tue, 15 Feb 2005 14:47:49 +0000
Subject: New software from Adobe available.
From: "Terence" <bob@example.com>
To: steve@example.net
User-Agent: SquirrelMail/1.4.3a
X-Mailer: SquirrelMail/1.4.3a
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
X-Priority: 3 (Normal)
Importance: Normal
</verb></tscreen>

This looks like the headers of some ordinary email, even down to the
SquirrelMail versions. However there is a couple of mistakes. The first being it
really wasn't sent from SquirrelMail by a user bob@example.com. To trace the
source of an email, you start at the bottom Received: line, and work upwards. In
this case, it says the email was sent from the IP 5.6.7.8 using the SquirrelMail
account bob@example.com on the domain randomdomainname.com. When SquirrelMail
really writes these headers, the randomdomainname.com is the actual webserver
address. The first thing to do is verify if this is in fact a real SquirrelMail
email. The quickest way is to validate the domain name. Using <url
url="http://www.internic.net/whois.html" name="InterNic"> it is possible to
lookup domain name information. In this case, randomdomainname.com doesn't
exist, so we already know that this line could be faked.

Assuming that line is faked, we move to the next one. This shows the IP address
123.123.123.123 connecting to example.com. For the sakes of example, example.com
is the actual address of the mail server for our domain. This shows that the IP
address 123.123.123.123 connected to our mail server to deliver the mail. This
is the most important line. Using <url url="http://www.geektools.com/whois.php"
name="GeekTools">, we can find out where the IP address belongs, which service
provider is the owner of the IP, and in most cases, who to contact in case of
abuse. In this example, we'll say the owner is homeagainisp.com, and they have
an abuse contact email. At which point, you can forward your email as an
attachment to the listed email address for the abuse contact. For clariety, 
and to save them the confusion of what you went through, reference this URL too,
so they can have a clue what is really going on. 

For another clue on the message being forged, view the Message-Id: header. In
this case it is <6pr9Lv.squirrel@5.6.7.8>. This is not a valid SquirrelMail
Message-Id. A valid Message-Id header looks something like this:

<tscreen><verb>
1123.145.23.250.17.squirrel@webserveraddress
</verb></tscreen>

This is another easy way to spot a forged message.

We do hope to stop this barrage of spam, unfortunately it is difficult to do, and
miss-identification doesn't help. This page was created in the hopes of
educating everybody into the background of this spam issue, and we hope it
helps.

<em>There are mistakes, or I have suggestions, where can I send them?</em>

The <url url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/squirrelmail-users" 
name="SquirrelMail users mailing list"> is often the best place to submit this
kind of information/requests.
