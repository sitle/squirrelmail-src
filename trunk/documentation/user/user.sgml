<sect>SquirrelMail overview
<p>
SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP. It includes
built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render
in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across
browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and
install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email
client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder manipulation.

<sect>Using SquirrelMail
<sect1>Overview
<p>
SquirrelMail is an interface to your organization's email system through the
web. It has all the functionality you would want from an email client, including
strong support for attachments, address books, calendar and folders.

SquirrelMail is also highly customizable. Your systems administrators can write,
install, and share "plugins" at your SquirrelMail server to extend its
functionality to meet your organization's needs.

Because of the high level of customization available to your organization with
SquirrelMail, some of the items in this manual may not apply to you. Most
should, and we have made every effort to note things that may differ in your
situation.

<sect1>Logging in
<p>
<enum>
  <item>Enter your username in the name field (if in doubt:
        &lt;username&gt;@&lt;your.domain&gt;).
  <item>Enter your password in the password field. Your password will show up as
        asterisks (*); this is a security feature to prevent other people from
        viewing your password when you type it in. The password must be exactly
        the same as configured in the IMAP Server (or your IPMAP mailer program)
   <item>Press the "Login" button.
</enum>

If you're can't get in, double check your username and password, and then
contact your administrator if you still have problems.

Some SquirrelMail installations, but not all, allow a user to change their
password through the web interface. If this is a feature you need, but don't
have, contact your administrator.

It is possible to create a link (or bookmark) to the login page that will make
it use a default username. To do this add the text <tt/?loginname=username/ to
the end of the URL (which previously ended with <tt/login.php/), here "username"
should be substituted by your actual username.

<sect1>Setting preferences
<p>
From any Squirrel Mail window, you can select "Options" at the top of the
screen, to review or edit your user preferences.

Options available are:
<itemize>
  <item>Personal information
  <item>Message highlighting
  <item>Index order
  <item>Display preferences
  <item>Folder preferences
</itemize>

<sect2>Personal information
<sect3>Name and Address Options (all fields are optional)
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Full Name/Enter your name. This will be used to identify you in outgoing
email.

<tag/Email Address/Enter your email address. Email you send will show this
address in the FROM: line.

<tag/Reply To/Enter the email address you would like people to reply to. Most
email clients will use this email address instead of the "From" address when
replying to mail you send.

<tag/Signature/If you would like to include a short message or "signature" at
the bottom of your emails, you can type it here.

<tag/Multiple Identities/If you like to have multiple email addresses,
signatures or names, you can enter them here, or select an already created
identity.

<tag/Your Current Timezone/Email usually includes a timestamp that tells the
receiver when you sent it. If you select your timezone here, the timestamp will
be more accurate. If not, the server's time zone is used.
</descrip>

<sect2>Display Preferences
<sect3>General Display Options
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Theme/Different color schemes are available. Themes with "(Changes)" after
their name may have a different color each time you log in.

<tag/Custom Stylesheet/Select a stylesheet to use a different size font. The
administrator may install special style sheets that further modify appearance.

<tag/Language/Select a different language to allow the reading and writing of
emails in that language. For example, to have Japanese emails display properly,
one must set this to Japanese.

<tag/Use JavaScript/
<descrip>
<tag/Autodetect/Detect if the web browser supports JavaScript
<tag/Always/Assume that JavaScript is supported
<tag/Never/Use plain HTML
</descrip>
</descrip>

<sect3>Mailbox Display Options
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Number of Messages to Index/The number of message to show per page.

<tag/Enable Alternating Row Colors/Show every other message with a different
color.

<tag/Enable Page Selector/Show page numbers that let you go straight to a
specific page.

<tag/Maximum Number of Pages to Show/How many page numbers to show. If there are
too many pages then they will be split like this: <tt/1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... 17 18 19
20/.
</descrip>

<sect2>Message highlighting
<p>
From almost any window, select "Options" from the menu at top. From the
resulting page, select "Message Highlighting". (Windows style: Select Options ->
Message Highlighting)

From this window, you can do these things:
<descrip>
<tag/Create a new highlight/Choose a scheme for highlighting messages that match
a particular pattern (see below).

<enum>
  <item>Choose: Options -> Message Highlighting
  <item>Choose: New
  <item>Assign a name to your new highlight style
  <item>Select a color for your highlight style
  <item>Select a criterion for the highlighted message. The criterion matches,
        if the string is contained within the specified field. E.g. highlighting
        all messages coming from domain "foo.bar" would be done by selecting
        "from" within the combobox and then type "@foo.bar" into the pattern
        field. The match is case-insensitive, and will match a header containing
        the search string anywhere within it - but no wild cards or regular
        expressions.
</enum>

<tag/Edit an existing highlight/Make changes to a given highlight style.

<tag/Delete an existing hightlight/Remove an existing highlight style from the
set.
</descrip>

<sect1>Reading e-mail
<p>
Click on a folder on the folder bar to display a list of messages in that
folder.

Unread messages cause the folder name to be bold. Once the folder is clicked on,
those unread messages are bold in the folder view. Click on the subject to read
the message.

A bar containing three fields (From, Date, and Subject) is next. These headings
separate the message table into logical parts. From tells you who sent you the
message, or at least what email address it came from. Date shows the day which
the email was sent. Subject displays what the sender entered as the subject.
Note: Between the Date and Subject columns is a small column that is unlabeled.
There could be a "+", "!" or an "A" in there. If you see the "+", that means
that the message has attachments; if you see the "A", that means that you have
answered the message, and if you see the "!", then the message was marked as
urgent!

<sect2>Reading attachments
<p>
If an email contains an attachment, it will be listed at the bottom of the email
when you are reading a message.

Depending on how your web browser is set up, it may know how to open various
types of attachments.

In order to view attachments, you must have a program that can open that type of
file.

<sect1>Sending e-mail
<p>
To send a new message, click on the compose link on the top of the screen. To
reply, click on reply or reply All on the top right of the message.

The address link will allow you to add addresses to the To: CC: or BCC: fields
from your address book.

A drop down box exists for selecting the priority of the message, and Rcpt check
boxes are there for openning and receiving of the email confirmations.

Depending on your option configuration, Sent messages may be stored in the sent
message folder, or they may be cc'ed to an address you specify.

<sect2>Attaching documents
<p>
To send an attachment, you must be composing a message.

At the bottom of the compose window, there should be a form field labeled Attach
with a Browse and an Add button next to it.

Click the Browse button. Locate the file on your computer that you want to
attach. Select it (single click) and click OK or Open.

The should now contain the location of the file, as well as the file's name.
Click Add to transfer the file to the SquirrelMail server.

The file's name should now be listed at the bottom of the compose screen, with a
checkbox next to it. The other information listed is the MIME type and the file
size in parenthesis.

You can add as many attachments to a message as you want. However, the files
should have different names. SquirrelMail will allow you to send a message
containing multiple attachments with the same name, but when the recipient saves
them, they may accidentally overwrite one with another.

If you want to remove one or more attachments from your message, check the
checkbox next to the attachment(s) you wish to delete and press the 'Delete
select attachments' button.

<sect2>Attachment compatibility and size
<p>
SquirrelMail sends your attachments in the industry standard MIME format.
However, this does nothing to ensure that the person you are sending the file to
can read the type of file you are sending. For example, if the file you are
sending is a Micorosoft Word 2000 document, and the recipient does not have a
program that can open Microsoft Word 2000 documents, the receipient will not be
able to view your attachment.

We recommend sending word processing documents in Rich Text Format, spreadsheets
in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, and images in either JPEG or PNG unless
you are absolutely sure that the person on the other end has the appropriate
software to handle your files.

You should also be mindful of the size in Kilobytes of your attachments. Images,
and word processing documents with images in them can get deceptively large. The
size of each of your attachments is listed in parenthesis by its name at the
bottom of the compose screen.

When the recipient receives your message, their email program will attempt to
download the message from the mail server to their computer. If you have a
message with attachments totalling 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes), then the
message will take about 8 minutes to transfer over a 56Kb modem. Since many
email programs do not appear to be doing anything when downloading large
messages, your receipient may think that their computer has crashed while it is
downloading your message! Then they may restart their computer and try all over
again with the same results.

Because of this potential situation, you may want to warn the recipient ahead of
time, either via a phone call or a smaller email sent ahead of time, if you
intend to send them a large attachment.

<sect>Security
<sect1>SquirrelMail spam
<p>
<em>Help, why am I getting this mail?</em>

Chances are you have been directed here for one of the following reasons.
<itemize>
  <item>You are receiving mail that has a header that looks like it was from SquirrelMail.
  <item>You are receiving MAILER-DAEMON errors reporting users don't exist, quoting headers showing SquirrelMail.
  <item>You are an ISP investigating spam levels.
</itemize>

If either of the above applies, chances are you have been caught in the latest
attempts at spam to fool anti-spam measures. A lot of spam has forged headers.
This means that they take pretend values, and substitute them to ill effect.
For example, replacing the from address with your email address (or a made up
address). This can also apply to the other headers as well. This is leading to
cases of SquirrelMail being accused of sending spam, or our servers being
hacked. Rest assured -- our servers are safe. In actual fact, we don't run any
servers at SquirrelMail.org. We do not even run mail services here, just
supplying our own software on a hosted service from <url
url="http://sourceforge.net" name="SourceForge">.

So you may be wondering why all this mail is coming from us? Well to be honest
it isn't. Some people have developed software that pretends to be our software,
and is producing a lot of noise on the Internet containing such information.
This is leading people to think our software is unsafe, or is acting as a spam
service.

<em>So why am I getting these emails?</em>

Well the truth of the matter is that somebody guessed your email. This isn't
uncommon if you have email addresses like bob@example.com. The spammers just
randomly pick domains, and randomly generate emails from that domain to send
mail from. All we can suggest is you delete them, or contact the correct
authorities (usually your service provider should be able to help).

<em>So what are you doing to stop this?</em>

Unfortunately there isn't much we can do. Because spam is such a problem on the
Internet, the best thing we can do is educate people into the real facts. Below
are some basic ideas on how to detect where these forged emails are coming from.
While this isn't easy for most people, it gets easier with practice. There is
always your service provider, they should be able to help you.

<em>Okay, so what is the secret? How do I find out who is doing this?</em>

Honestly, you cannot find out the exact person that is sending it, but you can
find out what the address (IP Address), and what service provider the mail was
sent via. Below is an example of the headers from a forged email:

<tscreen><verb>
Return-path: <bob@example.com>
Received: from [123.123.123.123] (helo=randomdomainname.com)
   by example.com with smtp (Exim 3.36 #5)
   id 1D13zJ-0003mr-00
   for steve@example.net; Tue, 15 Feb 2005 14:47:42 +0000
Received: from 5.6.7.8
   (SquirrelMail authenticated user bob@example.com); by
   randomdomainname.com with HTTP; Tue, 15 Feb 2005 14:47:49 +0000
Message-Id: <6pr9Lv.squirrel@5.6.7.8>
Date: Tue, 15 Feb 2005 14:47:49 +0000
Subject: New software from Adobe available.
From: "Terence" <bob@example.com>
To: steve@example.net
User-Agent: SquirrelMail/1.4.3a
X-Mailer: SquirrelMail/1.4.3a
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
X-Priority: 3 (Normal)
Importance: Normal
</verb></tscreen>

This looks like the headers of some ordinary email, even down to the
SquirrelMail versions. However there are a couple of mistakes. The first being
it really wasn't sent from SquirrelMail by a user bob@example.com. To trace the
source of an email, you start at the bottom Received: line, and work upwards. In
this case, it says the email was sent from the IP 5.6.7.8 using the SquirrelMail
account bob@example.com on the domain randomdomainname.com. When SquirrelMail
really writes these headers, the randomdomainname.com is the actual web server
address. The first thing to do is verify if this is in fact a real SquirrelMail
email. The quickest way is to validate the domain name. Using <url
url="http://www.internic.net/whois.html" name="InterNic"> it is possible to
lookup domain name information. In this case, randomdomainname.com doesn't
exist, so we already know that this line could be faked.

Assuming that line is faked, we move to the next one. This shows the IP address
123.123.123.123 connecting to example.com. For the sakes of example, example.com
is the actual address of the mail server for our domain. This shows that the IP
address 123.123.123.123 connected to our mail server to deliver the mail. This
is the most important line. Using <url url="http://www.geektools.com/whois.php"
name="GeekTools">, we can find out where the IP address belongs, which service
provider is the owner of the IP, and in most cases, who to contact in case of
abuse. In this example, we'll say the owner is homeagainisp.com, and they have
an abuse contact email. At which point, you can forward your email as an
attachment to the listed email address for the abuse contact. For clarity, and
to save them the confusion of what you went through, reference this URL too, so
they can have a clue what is really going on.

For another clue on the message being forged, view the Message-Id: header. In
this case it is <6pr9Lv.squirrel@5.6.7.8>. This is not a valid SquirrelMail
Message-Id. A valid Message-Id header looks something like this:

<tscreen><verb>
1123.145.23.250.17.squirrel@webserveraddress
</verb></tscreen>

This is another easy way to spot a forged message.

We do hope to stop this barrage of spam, unfortunately it is difficult to do,
and miss-identification doesn't help. This page was created in the hopes of
educating everybody into the background of this spam issue, and we hope it
helps.

<em>There are mistakes, or I have suggestions, where can I send them?</em>

The <url url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/squirrelmail-users"
name="SquirrelMail users mailing list"> is often the best place to submit this
kind of information/requests.

<sect1>Why are pictures in my HTML e-mails replaced with ugly warning signs?

<sect2>"This image has been removed for security reasons."
<p>
There are two kinds of images that come with your HTML e-mail: the ones that
come attached with the e-mail itself, and others that link to remote sites.
Images that are linked to remote sites are considered "unsafe" for the
following reasons:

<itemize>
	<item> Spammers can abuse this to validate your e-mail address
	<item> The sender can know instantly if you have read their e-mail or not (privacy concern)
	<item> Finding out information about your browser, operating system, and your mailserver (security concern).
</itemize>

Let's look at these issues in more detail:

<sect2>Validating your e-mail address
<p>
Spammers can (and do) include specially-crafted image tags that include a "web
bug" (usually a 1 pixel transparant image) used to validate that your e-mail
address is a live one and that you actually read e-mail sent to this address.
When such image is loaded, a request is sent to the spammer's server and it
notes in its database of e-mail addresses that you have, in fact, received and
read the spam e-mail they sent. Such addresses are re-sold to other spammers
and the amount of spam you will receive is going to grow exponentially.

<sect2>Verifying that you have read your e-mail
<p>
This issue is a privacy concern - if there are images in the e-mail that link
to the sender's website, they will know instantly when you have opened and read
the e-mail they sent. This can be used against you if for some reason you
decide to deny ever receiving that e-mail from the sender - they will have
proof that you have received, opened, and read that e-mail.

<sect2>Finding out information about you
<p>
Every time an image is loaded off the remote server, it leaves a "log" message
about what type of system you are using, including the version of your browser,
your internet IP address, as well as information about your mail server and the
software running on it. This information can be used to carry out attacks on
your computer or the server where SquirrelMail runs.

<sect2>Malicious tags
<p>
Images in email can also be used to auto-execute cross-site scripting code in a
attempt to trick your browser into revealing your account information to
crackers with malicious intent.

<sect2>Conclusion
<p>
For these reasons SquirrelMail does not display these "unsafe" images by
default, but instead shows you a warning sign. A link is provided to show
the images for that particular mail. If you know that the e-mail came
from a trustworthy source, you can use the Unsafe Image Rules plugin to always
images from that source.

<sect>FAQ
<sect1>How do I make Outlook talk to SquirrelMail?
<p>
The simple answer to that is: you don't.

SquirrelMail is a mail client, it talks to a mail server, fetches your mail,
displays your mail, and does all the nitty gritty work for you. This is also the
case with Outlook. It is a mail client. It talks to the mail server, fetches the
mail, and does all the nitty gritty work for you. Outlook cannot talk to
SquirrelMail because SquirrelMail itself is a client and not a server.

The best people to ask for the IMAP server settings your Outlook client needs,
are those with whom you are getting your mail services from. If you're not quite
sure, try hunting around the website you signed up on for support pages, or if
you are at a college, or university, speak to a teacher. There's no point in
contacting the SquirrelMail project team - the don't know the which settings you
need.
