<sect>SquirrelMail overview
<p>
SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4. It includes 
built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render
in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across
browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and 
install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email 
client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder manipulation.

<sect1>SquirrelMail Requirements
<sect2>Requirements for running SquirrelMail:
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>UNIX/Linux or Windows (UNIX/Linux version may be more functional)
  <item>IMAP4rev1 server (e.g. uw-imap, courier-imap, cyrus-imap, hMailServer, 
    Binc IMAP, CommuniGate, MS Exchange Server, MercuryMail 32, Dovecot)
  <item>Web server with PHP4 installed (preferably <url
    url="http://httpd.apache.org/" name="Apache httpd">)
  <item>You need at least PHP 4.1.2. If you are using PHP 4.1.2 or 4.1.4, please 
    upgrade to the latest version ( >= 4.1.2.11, >= 4.1.4.1 final).
  <item>Perl installed on the system. (If you don't have Perl, SquirrelMail will 
    work fine but it's very helpful for the initial configuration. 
    Alternatively, you can manually edit the configuration files.)
  <item>Unlike many PHP applications, SquirrelMail does not require MySQL or
    other database type.
  <item>If you use MySQL for the address book or for prefs, note that Pear DB
    lib is required to be installed and available in the include
    path.
  <item>Aspell installed if using the SquirrelSpell plugin, For UNIX/Linux see:
    <url url="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/" name="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">
    or for Windows, see: <url url="http://aspell.net/win32/" name="http://aspell.net/win32/">
  <item>Japanese language support: PHP must be compiled with the
    <tt/--enable-mbstring/ option for SquirrelMail to read and write Japanese
    emails. Each user must also set their language option to Japanese.
</itemize>

<sect2>Preferred configuration:
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>php with gettext and mbstring support. Without gettext you lose in
    performance. mbstring is actually required if you want a good i18n webmail
    system.
  <item>imap server that supports sort and thread imap extensions. Without these
    extensions you lose in performance.
  <item>imap server should support unicode. CourierIMAP must be compiled with
    <tt/--enable-unicode/ option. Without it some translations might be unable to use
    sorting and threading.
</itemize>

<sect2>Browser Requirements:
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Cookies must be enabled in your browser.
</itemize>

<sect>Upgrading SquirrelMail
<p>
This chapter talks about upgrading existing SquirrelMail install.

<sect1>Backup old install
<p>
Make a backup of your current SquirrelMail directory.  If you use "cp", be
sure to use the "-Rp" options.  -R means recursive, and -p will save the
permissions in the directory.

In this example, we assume that your httpd document directory is 
<tt>/home/httpd/html</tt>, that your SquirrelMail install is located at
<tt>/home/httpd/html/squirrelmail-1.0.6</tt>, and that your new SM version is 1.2.0.
Substitute version numbers and names as required.

<verb>
$ cd /home/httpd/html
$ cp -Rp squirrelmail-1.0.6 squirrelmail-1.0.6.bak
</verb>

<sect1>Unarchive new SquirrelMail
<p>
Make sure that you are in your httpd document directory (<tt>/home/httpd/html</tt>)
and then unarchive the SquirrelMail archive (whatever the filename is): 
<verb>
$ tar -zxvf squirrelmail-1.2.0.tar.gz
</verb>

<sect1>Copy important files from old install
<p>
The important files to copy are:
<itemize>
  <item>Preferences
  <item>Config details
  <item>Plugins
  <item>Themes (if you've edited or added any of them)
</itemize>

<sect2>Preferences
<p>
First, copy your preference data over to the new directory.  Usually
this is ok, but if you are upgrading from anything less than 1.0.5, we
strongly suggest you let your users reset their preferences.  There
were important security upgrades in 1.0.5 regarding preference files.
<verb>
$ cp squirrelmail-1.0.6.bak/data/* squirrelmail-1.2.0/data
</verb>
  
<sect2>Config details
<p>
If at all possible, start the configuration process from scratch.  It is 
much less prone to missing configuration options than copying your old
configuration.  Ideally, you should just run conf.pl to reconfigure
SquirrelMail.  If you decide to copy your old config.php over, we strongly
recommend that you run conf.pl to make sure things are correct and then save
the config file.
<verb>
$ cp squirrelmail-1.0.6.bak/config/config.php squirrelmail-1.2.0/config
</verb>

<sect2>Copy plugins
<p>
Like SquirrelMail, plugins are frequently updated for improvements, as well
as to make them compatible with new SquirrelMail releases.  It is suggested
that you download new versions of your plugins at the same time you download
your SquirrelMail install, and that you install your plugins fresh (it's
easy, don't panic!).

You should not try replacing plugins that are already included in SquirrelMail
package. Download latest versions of plugins that are not included in new
SquirrelMail package or copy them from older SquirrelMail install.

<sect2>Copy themes
<p>
If you've created or modified themes, you should copy just those to the new
SquirrelMail themes directory.  To just copy them all over to the new
SquirrelMail installation, you can run one command.
<verb>
$ cp -ui squirrelmail-1.0.6.bak/themes/* squirrelmail-1.2.0/themes/
</verb>

When <tt/-u/ flag is used, command copies only missing and newer files. 
When <tt/-i/ flag is used, command will ask for confirmation before replacing
existing files.

If you want to see your theme in future SquirrelMail packages, send it to 
SquirrelMail developers. They might add it to the themes in the standard
install!

<sect1>Change permissions
<p>
The web server must have write permission to the data directory.  In this
example, we assume that user "nobody" and group "nobody" are the web server
as is often the case with Apache.
<verb>
  $ cd squirrelmail-1.2.0
  $ chown -R nobody:nobody data
</verb>
  
Check your webserver's configuration file. It might be using different
userid/groupid pair. Additionally, if "chown user:group" doesn't work, you can
use "chown user" and "chgrp group" instead. See the man pages for these commands
for more information.

TODO: php safe_mode restrictions.

<sect1>Run conf.pl
<p>
Run config/conf.pl to see the new configuration options available with the
new version, as well as to verify that all of your old options are set
properly.

Always save your options, also if you haven't changed anything.
This will ensure that any problems with conf.pl that might have been solved
are effective to your installation.

If you want to make sure that your configuration contains all themes included in
new SquirrelMail package, go to theme options in configuration utility and 
run theme detection command.

<sect1>Version specific notes
<sect2>Upgrade from version older than 1.2.2 to later version.
<p>
In order to provide better i18n support, developers have changed names used by
translations. From 1.2.2 SquirrelMail uses language and country codes in
translation names. In most of cases upgraded SquirrelMail should work correctly.
only Norwegian Nynorsk (no_NO_ny) translation might need fixes. If your user
preference files contain <tt/language=no_NO_ny/ lines, these lines should be updated
to <tt/language=nn_NO/.

<sect2>Upgrade from 1.2.x or older versions to 1.4.x or later.
<p>
Layout changes. Plugins can break.

<sect2>Upgrade from version older than 1.4.4 to later version.
<p>
Translations are removed.

<sect2>Downgrade from 1.5.1 to older version.
<p>
Options -&lt; Index Order options are not preserved.

<sect1>Recheck new install
<p>
Login into new SquirrelMail install and check if everything is working.

<sect1>Replace old install.
<p>
Redirect your users to new SquirrelMail install. You can use Apache <url 
url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_alias.html#redirectperm"
name="RedirectPermanent"> directive or other redirection tools provided by your
webserver.

If you use SquirrelMail directory without version information, you can also
replace it with new SquirrelMail directory.
<verb>
$ mv /home/httpd/html/squirrelmail /home/httpd/html/squirrelmail.old
$ mv /home/httpd/html/squirrelmail.new /home/httpd/html/squirrelmail
</verb>

<sect1>DONE!
<p>
That should be all!  The most important part is copying your users'
preference files back into the new data directory.  This will insure that
your users will have their old preferences.  Remember to do so with caution,
especially if you are upgrading from a version before 1.0.5 to version 1.0.5
or later.
