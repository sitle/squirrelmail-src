<title>SquirrelMail Developer's Manual

This document provides information for the developers of the SquirrelMail
webmail interface.

Document version: $Revision$

<sect>SquirrelMail overview
<p>
SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP. It includes
built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render
in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across
browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and
install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email
client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder manipulation.

<sect1>The project goals
<p>
The founding principles of the SquirrelMail Project were aimed at an audience
that was looking for a webmail application that would run on low end servers for
clients with simple browsers and a small set of expectations. Well, the
SquirrelMail user base has swollen greatly beyond the expectations of the
original SquirrelMail developers. Much of this new audience often wants and
needs a webmail client that will be much, much more.

In order to meet adequately the expanded needs of our current client base, the
basic principles of the SquirrelMail Project must be expanded to include several
additional items. The SquirrelMail Project goals are:

<enum>
  <item>SquirrelMail must be <it/very easy/ to install and configure.
  <item>SquirrelMail must have low server <it/requirements/, allowing it to be
        run on low-end hardware with just a basic Apache and PHP installation.
  <item>SquirrelMail must have low client <it/requirements/, allowing it to be
        used on low end browsers without <it/requiring/ any fancy JavaScript, or
        so forth.
  <item>SquirrelMail will provide a <it/complete/ webmail application that can
        be used as an individual's primary access point to email.
  <item>SquirrelMail will maintain an architecture that will <it/flex/ to the
        needs of a variety of system administrators, server configurations, and
        web browsers while maintaining <it/efficiency/ and <it/speed/.
</enum>

An important note is that the principles should be expanded and not replaced.
This means that the original, founding requirements of the SquirrelMail project
must never be overlooked as new and cool things are developed. Rather, special
care should be taken to assure that both the new and the old is respected as
development progresses and the capabilities of SquirrelMail are extended.

<sect2>JavaScript
<p>
Some people argue that JavaScript isn't a fancy or heavy requirement anymore,
and that the project goals should be revised. Well, JavaScript is neat and all,
but some clients, such as lynx and links, lack support and will probably never
get it. However, most things that can be done with JavaScript can also be done
at the server side, and any JavaScript should only increase usability, not
functionality. JavaScript isn't supposed to be anywhere in HTML except where
JavaScript-aware browsers look anyway (i.e. in handlers for intrinsic events
such as <tt/onclick/, <tt/onload/, and <tt/onmouseover/). It's still important
to be able to use SquirrelMail with non-JavaScript-aware browsers. If you detest
lynx, think PDA, WAP and so on instead.

JavaScript code runs in the client browser but is not a "sandboxed" technology.
This means that client-side JavaScript code doesn't have near the restrictions
placed on it in regards to accessing local files and changing browser behavior
as do more security conscious technologies like Java. Web developers should
avoid using JavaScript in anything but the most trivial roles as site visitors
who value their privacy and security may have configured their browser to ignore
all or part of a page's JavaScript code. In addition to the myriad security and
privacy problems with client-side JavaScript, JavaScript code often introduces
browser dependencies due to slightly differing JavaScript parser implementations
in various web browsers. Microsoft's web application development environments
actually seem to take advantage of these incompatibilities to lock users into
Internet Explorer.

Web application developers are encouraged to perform all input manipulation in
server-side code or, if it is absolutely necessary, in client-side code that
runs in a protective environment or "sandbox". Input validation should always be
performed in server-side code despite the temptation to do so in client code in
order to leverage libraries that allow "easier" client-side data validation.
Google "Cross Site Scripting", "SQL Injection", and "client-side trust" for an
explanation of the pitfalls associated with weak client-side input validation. 

This doesn't mean that it's not allowed to make use of JavaScript in
SquirrelMail or its plugins, but as much of the functionality as possible
mustn't depend on it. Having extra JavaScript features is allowed if they
respect the users' JavaScript preference setting.

<sect1>Project management
<p>
The SquirrelMail Project Team is organized as four subteams, in order to get
more good stuff done in a more organized fashion. There is no official project
leader. Major decisions are more of a consensus between the team leaders. Each
subteam has a leader (or two), who is responsible for coordinating the
activities of their team, answering questions, and helping new
developers/contributors get started. Even though we have team leaders, all
project members are supposed to help out with the various tasks.

<sect1>The community
<sect2>Our most valuable resource
<p>
"If you treat your users as if they're your most valuable resource, they will
respond by becoming your most valuable resource"

Good projects in both the open source and commercial world succeed because of a
whole community of people who are involved in the project, not just because of
the small set of individuals who actually did the tinkering with the code. Open
source is power! Let's look at an example.

<sect2>A short case study
<p>
<it/"Who in the computer world doesn't know what WinAmp is? WinAmp, as far as I
can tell, is the Windows MP3 player that was at the forefront of the
intersection between the world of Windows users and the emerging standard of MP3
for digitally recorded audio. What about WinAmp made it so successful? Was it
just because the program was the greatest thing in the world?/

<it/No, I think not. In fact, from everything I have ever seen, there are some
really annoying things about the program. What made it so successful, in my
opinion, is the community that grew around it./

<it/When I first saw WinAmp, it was on a college campus. My computer only had
Linux on it, so I did not install WinAmp. However, I noticed that it seemed
everyone in the dormitory seemed to have WinAmp installed. More than that, they
really were very big on the program. They loved the skins. They IDENTIFIED with
it./

<it/What is that? That is community. That is a person feeling that they are no
longer just a user of the program, but part of the program itself. No, I am not
talking about some new-age "being one with the program" thing here. I am just
talking about the difference between feeling as if you are a part of something,
or just an outsider."/

<sect2>What does this have to do with SquirrelMail?
<p>
The community of SquirrelMail itself is worth much more than just the sum of the
developers. Just like a bright flashlight is dwarfed by the brightness of the
sun, the SquirrelMail community must shine much brighter than the SquirrelMail
development team itself. If it doesn't, SquirrelMail will not survive. After
all, developers are real people. Real people graduate, have kids, get married,
get busy, or get hit by ice cream trucks. Life goes on. The strength of the
SquirrelMail community itself guarantees that there will always be life beneath
the surface as it will continue to feed the strength of the development team
itself.

<sect2>The SquirrelMail Project Team
<p>
The SquirrelMail Project Team isn't just the developers. The change from being
the SquirrelMail Development Team is to make that point more obvious. There are
a lot of other peoples helping out too. Here are some examples:

<bf/Translators:/ A good percentage of the SquirrelMail end users don't
understand English. The SquirrelMail translators work hard to make it so that
people who use other languages still can use SquirrelMail. Who cares about some
fancy new feature that a developer implements - if it is only available in
English, it can not be globally used.

<bf/User support:/ Thank goodness for our precious user support people. These 
people patiently, repeatedly, respond to people's inquiries on the SquirrelMail 
mailing lists. They often answer the same questions over and over, and are very 
patient and consistent with their help. Without these people, where would we be?

So, in short and again, the point is that SquirrelMail is simply a lot more then
its developers. We should all try to make the SquirrelMail community stronger,
and the rest of the Project Team is just as important as the developers. We can
only succeed by the time and effort of the team as a whole.

<sect>General guidelines
<sect1>Coding guidelines
<p>
To ensure that the SquirrelMail affects the logs as little as possible, executes
as quickly as possible and stays readable to the developers, please follow these
rules when coding.

<descrip>
<tag>Code with secure global variables
<p>
All code must work with the PHP setting <tt/register_globals/ set to <tt/off/.
This isn't hard, but you'll have to let go the idea that any variable that is
passed via GET, POST, sessions or cookies is available right away. <url
url="http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.register-globals" name="The PHP
manual"> has a chapter on the subject, explaining the problem more in detail.

There's a special function in SquirrelMail, <tt/sqGetGlobalVar()/, designed to
retrieve variables in a safe way. Use this function instead of accessing
<tt/$_GET/ etc. directly. Here's an example:

<tscreen><verb>
global $favorite_color;
sqgetGlobalVar('favorite_color', $favorite_color, SQ_FORM);
</verb></tscreen>

In the past, there have been some rather serious issues with PHP sessions and
SquirrelMail. Thus, if you need to place any values into the user's session,
there are some built-in SquirrelMail functions that you are strongly encouraged
to make use of. Using them also makes your job easier.

Strictly speaking, globalizing the variable shouldn't be necessary for the
SquirrelMail session functions, but certain versions of PHP seem to behave more
predictably if you do.

<tscreen><verb>
function demo_session($favorite_color = 'green') {
    global $favorite_color;

    // Placing a variable into the session:
    sqsession_register($favorite_color, 'favorite_color');

    // Retrieving a variable from the session:
    sqgetGlobalVar('favorite_color', $favorite_color, SQ_SESSION);

    // Checking for the presence of a variable in the session:
    if (sqsession_is_registered('favorite_color')) {
        // do something important
    }

    // Removing a variable from the session:
    sqsession_unregister('favorite_color');
}
</verb></tscreen>

Don't use the standard PHP functions <tt/session_register()/ and
<tt/session_unregister()/.

Be conscious of variable names and how they might interfere with one another for
SquirrelMail installations with <tt/register_globals/ set to <tt/on/. That is,
if you use a variable called <tt/$username/ (and do not declare it as global),
it will have a local scope and have no effect outside of the current function
with <tt/register_globals/ set to <tt/off/, but it would have potentially
disastrous effects in an environment where <tt/register_globals/ is set to
<tt/on/.

Since SquirrelMail 1.4.7 and 1.5.1, globals are cleaned in
<tt>functions/global.php</tt>. Make sure to include that file before setting any
own global variables. If variables are set before loading
<tt>functions/global.php</tt>, they can be corrupted in setups with
<tt/register_globals/ set to <tt/on/.

Read more about the functions in the SquirrelMail API Documentation.

        name="development">)
</itemize>

<tag>Protect incoming and outgoing data
<p>
Any untrusted data must be escaped before output. This is to prevent cross site
scripting attacks. Pass every variable that comes in through the URL, a mail
message, or other external factors, through <tt/htmlspecialchars()/ before
outputting it. Test incoming data to see if it's the right format. If, for
instance, an integer is expected; test it with <tt/is_int()/. If the data is
expected to be within a certain range, make sure that it's really within that
range before using it.

<tag>Keep the code log safe
<p>
SquirrelMail code must be log safe code, i.e. do everything to avoid PHP notices
and other error messages, so SquirrelMail developers should always have error
reporting turned all the way up. You can do this by changing two settings in
your <tt/php.ini/ and restarting your web server:

<tscreen><verb>
display_errors = On
error_reporting = E_ALL
</verb></tscreen>

This way, you'll be sure to see all notices, warnings, and errors that your code
might generate. Please make sure to fix them all before you releasing your code.
This includes to initialize variables (just <tt/$a = 0/ is initialization) and
to use <tt/isset()/ or <tt/empty()/ in tests. Use <tt>ini_get("safe_mode")</tt>
to determine if you can use <tt>putenv()</tt>.

<tag>Do not end a file with a PHP end tag
<p>
At the very end of the file, do not use the PHP end tag <tt/?&gt;/ to close off
the file. It may seem innocuous, but if you have any blank lines either before
the first <tt/&lt;?php/ tag or after the last <tt/?&gt;/ tag in any of your
plugin files, you will break SquirrelMail in ways that may seem entirely
unrelated. For instance, this will often cause a line feed character to be
included with email attachments when they are viewed or downloaded, rendering
them useless! Files which aren't included by other files, for instance the files
in the directory <tt>src/</tt>, may of course end with HTML whereas included
files may not.

To ensure compability with all PHP installations, SquirrelMail code uses the
recommended PHP start tag <tt/&lt;?php/.

<tag>Group statements with braces
<p>
There shouldn't be a space between functions etc. and the brackets when using
them, except when writing <url
url="http://php.net/manual/en/language.control-structures.php" name="control
structures">. The use of braces, i.e. "{" and "}", is mandatory, even when
grouping just one statement. The indentation is done using spaces, never
tabulators, using four spaces per indentation level.

<bf>Examples:</bf>

<tscreen><verb>
if ($result > 5) {
    return TRUE;
} else {
    return FALSE;
}

function severeTesting() {
    ...
}
</verb></tscreen>

<tag>Keep the code internationalized
<p>
All SquirrelMail strings, but those in the configuration tools
<tt>config/conf.pl</tt> and <tt>src/configtest.php</tt>, must be
internationalized.

<tag>Use Single quotes when possible
<p>
Use single quotes (') instead of double quotes (") as much as possible because
it's faster to execute, but remember that you must use double quotes (") with
the <tt>gettext()</tt> strings (e.g. <tt>_("Translatable string")</tt>). Use
single quotes (') to refer an index between brackets of an array (example:
<tt>$foo['name']</tt> and not <tt>$foo[name]</tt>).

<tag>Use UNIX style line breaks
<p>
Use UNIX style line breaks when coding (i.e. line feeds only - no carriage
returns) and keep lines no longer than 80 characters when possible. Remember
that it isn't allowed to have a break in the middle of a <tt>gettext()</tt>
string.

<tag>Write useful documentation
<p>
The SquirrelMail Project use <url url="http://phpdocu.sf.net"
name="phpDocumentor"> to document the source code. Try to follow some common
sense and document what is really needed. Documenting the code properly can be a
big help for those who will take a look at your code, fix the bugs and even
improve it, in the true open-source spirit that SquirrelMail was built upon.
Anyone who adds or modifies a function, must add basic documentation about what
it does. In short, that looks like this for the following fantasy function:

<tscreen><verb>
/**
 * This function sends an IMAP query to the server and checks for
 * errors.
 * @param string servername The hostname of the IMAP server.
 * @param string query The IMAP query to send.
 * @param bool silent True if errors should be ignored silently.
 * @return array An array containing the results of the query.
 */
function sqimap_query($servername, $query, $silent = false) {
...
</verb></tscreen>

Every PHP file must have a general description of its content, like the example
below.

<tscreen><verb>
/**
 * about.php
 *
 * An "about box" detailing SquirrelMail info.
 *
 * @copyright &ero;copy; 1999-2006 The SquirrelMail Project Team
 * @license http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php GNU Public License
 * @version &#36;Id: about.php,v 1.12 2006/04/05 00:22:11 stekkel Exp $
 * @package squirrelmail
 */
</verb></tscreen>

Plugins must have the package "plugins" and a subpackage tag with the name of
the plugin, which is "demo" in this example:

<tscreen><verb>
 * @package plugins
 * @subpackage demo
</verb></tscreen>

Extended phpDocumentor documentation can be found in the <url
url="http://phpdoc.org/docs/HTMLSmartyConverter/default/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.pkg.html"
name="phpDocumentor Guide to Creating Fantastic Documentation">.

<tag>Output larger chunks of HTML outside PHP
<p>
When echoing chunks of HTML code it is better/faster to do it outside of PHP
mode and embed the occasional <tt>&lt;?php echo $variable; ?&gt;</tt> than to
put the whole lot in one or more PHP echo statements.

<tag>Refer peekers to the top level
<p>
Every subdirectory of SquirrelMail, including the plugin directories, must
contain an index file. In the documentation directory, the index file displays
the various documents, but in all other directories it's a reference to the
parent directory. At the root directory there's a reference to the login page.

Plugins developers can accomplish may copy the file <tt/index.php/ from the main
plugins directory and then modify the documentation in it as mentioned above.

</descrip>

If you have any questions about security or are unsure, please contact the mailing
list or IRC channel, because security is very important for a widely used
application like SquirrelMail!

<sect1>Including files
<p>
It's sometimes needed to reference functionality provided in other files, and
therefore those files need to be included. Files that are included by
SquirrelMail, such as <tt>functions/global.php</tt> or a plugin's
<tt/setup.php/, already have much of the functionality available, but files that
are requested directly by the client browser, such as files in <tt>src/</tt> or
a plugin's custom options page, <it/must/ have the initialization file included.

The initialization file will set up the SquirrelMail environment automatically
to ensure that the user has been authenticated and is currently logged in, all
user preferences are loaded, internationalization support is included, that
<tt/stripslashes()/ is used on all incoming data (if <tt/magic_quotes_gpc/ is
on), and that all other basic SquirrelMail resources and functions are
initialized and included.

Note that as of SquirrelMail 1.4.0, all files are accessed using a constant
called <tt/SM_PATH/ that always contains the relative path to the main
SquirrelMail directory. This constant is always available for use when including
other files from the SquirrelMail core or any plugins. For files that are
requested directly by the client browser, it needs to be set.

<sect2>Including the initialization file (before SquirrelMail 1.5.2)
<p>
Before you do anything else, you need to define the constant <tt/SM_PATH/ and
include the initialization file. Make sure that <tt/SM_PATH/ points at the top
level of the SquirrelMail installation. Here's an example for a plugin:

<tscreen><verb>
/** @ignore */
define('SM_PATH', '../../');

/* Including the SquirrelMail initialization file. */
include_once(SM_PATH . 'include/validate.php');
</verb></tscreen>

The list below contains the files that are included by
<tt>include/validate.php</tt>. If the SquirrelMail version isn't listed, files
are included from v.1.3.2.

   8.4. functions/global.php
9. functions/prefs.php (already loaded. see 7.2)
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Including the initialization file (since SquirrelMail 1.5.2)
<p>
Before you do anything else, you need to include the initialization file. Here's
an example for a plugin:

<tscreen><verb>
/* Include the SquirrelMail initialization file. */
require('../../include/init.php');
</verb></tscreen>

This takes care of setting up the session, defining the constants like
<tt/SM_PATH/, and includes a minimum set of required files.

The files which are included by <tt>include/init.php</tt> depends on which file
the client browser requested. All files in <tt>src/</tt> include the following
files:

<itemize>
  <item><tt>config/config.php</tt>
  <item><tt>functions/display_messages.php</tt>
  <item><tt>functions/global.php</tt>
  <item><tt>functions/html.php</tt>
  <item><tt>functions/page_header.php</tt>
  <item><tt>functions/plugin.php</tt>
  <item><tt>include/constants.php</tt>
  <item><tt>include/languages.php</tt>
</itemize>

Except for <tt/login.php/ and <tt/redirect.php/, they also include:

<itemize>
  <item><tt>functions/strings.php</tt>
  <item><tt>functions/auth.php</tt>
</itemize>

<tt/login.php/ also includes:

<itemize>
  <item><tt>functions/prefs.php</tt>
  <item><tt>functions/db_prefs.php</tt> or <tt>functions/file_prefs.php</tt>
        depending of the configured preference backend.
</itemize>

Because the use of <tt/require()/ in <tt>include/init.php</tt>, a plugin will fail if it
tries to include already included files. Be aware of that.

<sect2>Including other files
<p>
When including files, please make sure to use the <tt/include_once()/ function
and <it/not/ <tt/include()/ or <tt/require()/. They can cause fatal errors when
other plugins or SquirrelMail files include the same file. If you use
<tt/require_once()/ instead of <tt/include_once()/, PHP will raise a fatal
error if something goes wrong with the inclusion. That's the reason plugins
<it/must/ use <tt/include_once()/ instead of <tt/require_once()/.

Files that aren't included by the initialization file can be included like this:

<tscreen><verb>
include_once(SM_PATH . 'functions/imap_general.php');
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>The base URI funcion

FIXME: Add information about the base URI funcion.

<sect1>Version numbering
<sect2>The version number format<label id="versionformat">
<p>
The approach we take for version numbering is very similar to the way the Linux
kernel handles it. With this approach, it is easy to tell what's going on just
by looking at the three-part version number. The <it>full version number</it> is
a three-part number, using the format <tt>x.y.z</tt>, indicating a specific
implementation of SquirrelMail. Our examples will be <tt>1.0.6</tt> and
<tt>1.1.2</tt>.

The first number is the <it>major release number</it> (that's the <tt>x</tt>).
At first, this was <tt>0</tt> which meant we hadn't had any major releases yet.
In January of 2001, we released <tt>1.0.0</tt> which was our first major stable
release, and everything since then has been in the <tt>1</tt> family.

A major release of SquirrelMail should have a high-level set of specific goals
that it is meeting. For SquirrelMail 1.0, this was the reaching of a stable
release. For later versions, this may include implementation of more modular
libraries and API behind the code, a templating system for the user-interface,
and so forth.

The second number is the <it>minor release number</it> (that's the <tt>y</tt>).
The minor release number will tell you whether a release is a <it>stable</it> or
<it>development</it> branch of SquirrelMail. Even numbers (<tt>0</tt>,
<tt>2</tt>, <tt>4</tt>...) mean that it's a <it>stable</it> release, and odd
numbers (<tt>1</tt>, <tt>3</tt>, <tt>5</tt>...) mean it's a <it>development</it>
release.

A minor release of SquirrelMail should have a lower-level set of specific goals
that it is meeting. These goals should, somehow or another :), be a subset of
the goals for the major release of which it is a part. Basically, the minor
releases allow for the major goals of a major release to be broken into a more
discrete, attainable set of objectives.

Lastly, the final number is a <it>release incrementor</it> (that's the
<tt>z</tt>). In a stable branch, new versions of SquirrelMail will be release as
bugs are found and squished. In a development branch, new versions of
SquirrelMail will be released as progress is made toward the goals set for the
next major and minor release. New releases will happen <it>as needed</it> in a
stable branch. In a development branch, however, they should happen
<it>frequently</it>, as more progress is made toward the next minor release.

<sect2>Important points
<p>

<itemize>
  <item>Versions with a even minor release number are stable.
  <item>Versions with a odd minor release number are development.
  <item>New incremental releases in a stable branch should ONLY CONTAIN bug
        fixes. New features should always be implemented in the current
        development branch.
</itemize>

<sect2>The release timeline
<p>
The goals and objectives for each minor release should be carefully chosen so
that a new minor release can take place every three to four months. This is so
that our users can see actual improvements and will stick with us as we work to
make SquirrelMail a better web mail application.

<sect1>Submitting a patch
<p>
If you do not have commit access to the SquirrelMail Project Subversion (SVN), you can
provide a patch for bugs or features that you want to add. The developers will
then decide whether or not it can be applied to SquirrelMail. You can submit
your patch through the patches tracker on SourceForge.net, or you can attach it
to an existing bug report or feature request.

Important points when writing a patch, to improve the chances that it will be
committed:

<itemize>
  <item>Patch against the latest SVN version (prefered) or the latest released
        version.
  <item>Always use <tt/diff -u/. Do not submit entire changed files or use
        different patch options. Make sure you don't reverse the patch.
  <item>Take care to follow the SquirrelMail coding guidelines.
</itemize>

Do you feel that your patch is ignored? Feel free to ask on the <url
url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/admin/admin-12.html#mailinglists"
name="SquirrelMail development mailing list">.

</itemize>

<sect1>The <tt>$languages</tt> array<label id="languages_array">
<p>
The <tt>$languages</tt> array is defined in <tt>functions/i18n.php</tt> (which has been
moved to <tt>include/languages.php</tt> as of SquirrelMail 1.5.2) and defines translations
that are enabled in SquirrelMail. Starting with SquirrelMail 1.5.1, only the English
language entry is defined in the core; other languages are added automatically to the
<tt>$languages</tt> array from a file in the locale pack:
<tt>locale/&lt;language_code&gt;/setup.php</tt>.

Format of array:

<tscreen><verb>
    $languages['language_code']['key'] = 'value';
</verb></tscreen>

Possible array key names:
<descrip>
  <tag/NAME/ The name of the language in English. HTML encoding must be used for
             any 8-bit symbols.
  <tag/ALTNAME/ The native language name (the name of the language in that language
                itself). HTML encoding must be used for any 8-bit symbols. This name
                is shown when <tt>$show_alternative_names</tt> is enabled in
                <tt>config/config.php</tt> (or use the configuration utiltiy and
                choose "10. Language settings" --> "3. Show alternative language names")
                (for SquirrelMail 1.5.0 and up).
  <tag/CHARSET/ The character set used for the translation.
  <tag/LOCALE/ The full locale name (in "xx_XX.charset" format or other format required
               by PHP gettext functions). Starting with 1.4.4/1.5.1 and up, 'value' can
               contain an array. If the PHP version is older than 4.3.0, the system will
               use only the first locale name listed in the array. The first locale name
               must be compatible with the FreeBSD system locale names. Under all other
               setups, if the first locale is not supported, SquirrelMail will continue
               to try the other locales in the order given in this array. Developers
               can check for supported locale names on their system by checking the
               contents of, for example, <tt>/usr/lib/locale/</tt> (RedHat/Fedora).
  <tag/ALIAS/ Any number of aliased language codes can be linked to a given translation
              by creating one ALIAS entry for each link. The 'language_code' for the
              alias should contain the aliased language code and the 'value' should
              contain the language code SquirrelMail uses to store the actual translation.
              For example, the <url url="http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail/trunk/locales/locale/nb_NO/setup.php?view=markup" name="Norwegian">
              Translation is stored in SquirrelMail as "nb_NO", but it also has an
              alias for its ISO-639-1 code "nb".
              See: <url url="http://loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langhome.html"
              name="ISO 639 list"> and
              <url url="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html"
              name="country code list">
  <tag/DIR/ The text direction of the language. This is used to indicate
            right-to-left languages and is not needed otherwise. Possible
            values are 'rtl' or 'ltr' (when undefined, it defaults to 'ltr').
  <tag/XTRA_CODE/ Indicates that the translation uses special functions. (see
                  <ref id="language_xtra_code" name="chapter about XTRA_CODE functions">)
</descrip>

Note that each 'language_code' definition requires at least the NAME and CHARSET keys
or just the ALIAS key. All other keys are optional.

<sect1>XTRA_CODE functions<label id="language_xtra_code">
<p>
XTRA_CODE functions provide way to change interface behavior, when translation
requires special handling of some SquirrelMail functions. Functions are enabled
by setting XTRA_CODE option in $languages array and including appropriate
functions in <tt>functions/i18n.php</tt>. First part of function name is word listed in
$languages['language_code']['XTRA_CODE'] value. Second part is one of special
keywords. Possible keywords:
<descrip>
 <tag/_decode/ Used in <tt>src/compose.php</tt>, <tt>src/i18n.php</tt>, <tt>src/view_text.php</tt>, and <tt>functions/mime.php</tt>.
Requires mbstring support.

 <tag/_encode/ Used in <tt>src/compose.php</tt>, and <tt>src/read_body.php</tt>.

 <tag/_encodeheader/ Used in <tt>functions/mime.php</tt>. Should accept one string
 argument and return correctly encoded MIME header string.

 <tag/_decodeheader/ Used in <tt>functions/mime.php</tt>. Returning function.

 <tag/_downloadfilename/ Used in <tt>functions/mime.php</tt>.

 <tag/_utf7_imap_encode/ Used in <tt>functions/imap_utf7_local.php</tt>. Returning function.

 <tag/_utf7_imap_decode/ Used in <tt>functions/imap_utf7_local.php</tt>. Returning function.

 <tag/_strimwidth/ Used in <tt>functions/mailbox_display.php</tt>. Returning function.

 <tag/_wordwrap/ Used in <tt>functions/strings.php</tt> (sqWordWrap).
</descrip>

<sect1>Display of different charsets
<p>
When SquirrelMail generates HTML pages, it uses charset defined in translation
selected by end user. Interface can display emails encoded in different
charsets. In order to display characters that might be unsupported by user's
charset, SquirrelMail uses decoding functions that convert non us-ascii symbols
into HTML entities. All decoding functions are stored in functions/decode/
directory.

By default SquirrelMail includes decoding functions that support iso-8859-x,
windows-125x, utf-8, us-ascii, koi8-r, koi8-u, tis-620, ns-4551_1, iso-ir-111,
cp855 and cp866 charsets. Other decoding functions are distributed in separate
packages. Separate packaging of decoding functions is supported from
SquirrelMail 1.4.4 and 1.5.0. us-ascii decoding replaces all 8bit symbols with
question marks. UTF-8 decoding function does not enable decoding of five and six
byte UTF-8 symbols by default (code is commented) and replaces all incorrectly
formated 8bit symbols with question marks.

Some decoding functions might require PHP recode extension or PHP 4.3+ mbstring
extension. If your PHP installation does not support them, you might be using
slower and cpu/memory intensive functions.

<sect1>IMAP folder names
<p>
IMAP folder names use UTF7-IMAP charset. Folder names that are stored in
conf.pl must be encoded in UTF7-IMAP charset. SquirrelMail uses internal
functions that convert folder names from/to UTF7-IMAP charset. By default those
functions work with ISO-8859-1 charset. Other charsets are supported only
when PHP mbstring extension supports them.

TODO: Write independent implementation of charset to UTF7-IMAP conversion.

<sect1>Plural forms
<p>
Since 1.5.1, SquirrelMail includes support of plural forms. It allows to use
correct translation forms with numbers. For example. "We have %s squirrel on
the roof." and "We have %s squirrels on the roof." can be written in one
function call without checking actual number for squirrels. Gettext functions
also deal with non English languages that might use different word forms for
two, five, ten or more units.

Support is provided by ngettext functions that exist in PHP gettext extension
from PHP 4.2.0 and by ngettext function replacements from php-gettext classes
(http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/php-gettext). In order to use it correctly
when PHP gettext extension does not have ngettext support, SquirrelMail uses
bindtextdomain and textdomain wrappers that load missing functions.

If plugins want to use ngettext functions without increasing PHP requirements
to 4.2.0 with gettext support, they should require SquirrelMail 1.5.1, use
sq_bindtextdomain function instead of bindtextdomain and use sq_textdomain
function instead of textdomain function. If SquirrelMail wrapper functions
are used, there is no need to issue sq_bindtextdomain when plugins reverts to
SquirrelMail domain.

More information about ngettext and plural forms can be found at:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_10.html#SEC150

<sect1>Language setup
<p>
SquirrelMail uses <tt>set_up_language()</tt> function to setup language environment.
Environment is setup automatically when <tt>include/validate.php</tt> is loaded.

SquirrelMail gets interface language from three places:
 a) user preference. It is set in Options -> Display Preferences -> Language.
    preference uses language key. If user's preferences are not available (user
    is not logged in), system tries to extract language value from
    'squirrelmail_language' cookie.
 b) default SquirrelMail language that is set in configuration
    ($squirrelmail_default_language variable).
 c) preferred language setting provided by browser. It is used only when default
    SquirrelMail language is set to empty string

If language information is not available, SquirrelMail falls back to US English
translation.

<sect1>Time zones
<p>
If the PHP installation allows modifying environment variable TZ, SquirrelMail allows
the end users to select different time zone in their preferences. It can be set in
Options -> Personal Information -> Your current timezone. Time zone is
setup automatically when <tt>include/validate.php</tt> is loaded.

If TZ variable can't be modified (PHP is running is safe mode and variable
is not listed in PHP safe_mode_allowed_env_vars), user's time zone options are
not visible and interface use default webserver's time zone.

SquirrelMail 1.5.0 and older store list of available time zones in
<tt>locale/timezones.cfg</tt>. Since 1.5.1 standard times zones are moved to
<tt>include/timezones/standard.php</tt> and time zone handling differs from older
SquirrelMail versions. Time zone configuration is controlled in SquirrelMail
configuration utility (<tt/conf.pl/), 4. General Options &gt; 15. Time zone
configuration menu option. Administrator can select standard, strict, custom
and custom strict time zone handling.

Standard handling does not differ from previous SquirrelMail versions and
SquirrelMail uses GNU C geographical location based time zone names. Strict
handling uses time zone codes with offset from GMT. Strict time zones should
work on systems that don't support GNU C time zone naming. Custom and custom
strict handling uses <tt>config/timezones.php</tt> file instead of
<tt>include/timezones/standard.php</tt>.

<tt>config/timezones.php</tt> file should store $aTimeZones array with different set of
time zones. See default time zone set in <tt>include/timezones/standard.php</tt>. For
example:

<tscreen><verb>
&lt;?php

</verb></tscreen>

GNU C time zone naming should be supported by many Unix OSes. It is recommended
way of setting time zone, because it handles historical changes and daylight
savings specific to selected geographical location. Strict time zones might
provide inaccurate or outdated time zone settings.

If modifications in TZ environment are visible in your webserver's logs (time
offset is changed), make sure that you can reproduce such behavior in latest PHP
version and report bug to PHP developers. Issue can be fixed by blocking use of
time zone (PHP safe mode and TZ is not listed in safe_mode_allowed_env_vars
setting or forced_prefs plugin) or by attaching special PHP script with
putenv('TZ=some time zone') call in PHP auto_append_file setting (suggestion is
not tested and you might have to fix all SquirrelMail exit calls).

Please note, that use of auto_append_file provides only temporally workaround
and does not fix your PHP setup. Script that runs as unprivileged user, should
be unable to affect webserver's logging system.

<sect1>Sanitizing HTML strings
<p>
PHP provides the functions <tt><url url="http://php.net/htmlspecialchars"
name="htmlspecialchars()"></tt> and <tt><url
url="http://php.net/htmlentities" name="htmlentities()"></tt> for HTML
string sanitizing. When SquirrelMail developers want to sanitize HTML formating
symbols, they should use <tt>htmlspecialchars()</tt> and avoid using
<tt>htmlentities()</tt>.

<tt>htmlentities()</tt> uses the ISO-8859-1 charset by default, sanitizing the
ISO-8859-1 eight bit symbols. Other charsets use the same eight bit ranges to
store different symbols, so this will break all translations not using
ISO-8859-1.

Depending on the parameters, <tt>htmlspecialchars()</tt> only sanitizes three,
four or five seven bit symbols (&ero;, &dquot;, ', &lt; and &gt;).
<tt>htmlspecialchars()</tt> only breaks HTML encoded strings using the <url
url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_2022" name="ISO-2022"> charsets. ISO-2022
charsets use seven bit ranges to store different symbols. The used encoding
table depends on escape sequences present in ISO-2022 text.

A charset option is added to <tt>htmlentities()</tt> and
<tt>htmlspecialchars()</tt> since PHP 4.1.0 but list of supported charsets is
limited. The fallback charset is same good old and dangerous ISO-8859-1.

Differences between two functions can be examined with the <tt><url
url="http://php.net/get-html-translation-table"
name="get_html_translation_table()"></tt> function.

If SquirrelMail charset decoding functions are used, they should apply
<tt>htmlspecialchars()</tt> to the decoded string automatically. Don't try to
use <tt>htmlspecialchars()</tt> twince on the same string, since that might
break the decoded string.

<sect>Developing plugins<label id="developing_plugins">
<p>
SquirrelMail is built with an ingenious and powerful system that allows
add-ons known as plugins to extend its feature set in almost infinite
directions. This is one of the main reasons cited when users and
administrators explain SquirrelMail as their webmail of choice, and the
technology behind it has also been borrowed for other projects.

It is also thanks to the many plugin authors that have contributed large
amounts of code and a wide array of functionality ideas that SquirrelMail
is as popular as it is. The SquirrelMail team would like to encourage
authors to contribute in the best way possible, which is what the following
information will enable them to do. If you are considering adding a feature
to SquirrelMail, this is the best place to start.

<sect1>Before embarking<label id="before_developing_plugins">
<p>
One of the most fun parts about programming is seeing an idea turn into a
working product - the transition from "what if SquirrelMail could do..."
to "SquirrelMail <em/can/ do..." The SquirrelMail team can appreciate and
relate to that kind of enthusiasm, but we also don't want to see it go to
waste. Therefore, the first thing to be done before considering the development
of a new plugin (for public consumption at least) is to ask the SquirrelMail
team if anyone has already attempted to implement the idea. It is also
extremely helpful to announce your intentions in public so that the
SquirrelMail community can provide feedback and help refine the idea <em/before/
it is implemented.

Additionally, in keeping with the SquirrelMail theme of providing a product
that is simple to install and maintain, the team's philosophy regarding
plugins is to avoid the "Firefox syndrome", wherein it can take hours for
an administrator to understand what plugin is the right one for them.
Plugins that contain similar feature sets should be merged and authors should
work collaboratively instead of duplicating each others' efforts. If there
is a plugin on the SquirrelMail web site that <em/almost/ does what you
want to do, please inquire with its author and/or the SquirrelMail team
about enhancing it with your ideas.

<sect1>The plugin architecture<label id="plugin_architecture">
<p>
The plugin architecture of SquirrelMail is designed to make it possible to add
new features without having to patch SquirrelMail itself. Functionality like
changing user passwords, displaying ads, and calendars should be possible to add
as plugins. In this scheme, either package (SquirrelMail or a plugin) may be
upgraded independently without risk of one breaking the other.

<sect2>The idea
<p>
The idea is to be able to run plugin code at given places in the SquirrelMail
core. The plugin code should then be able to do whatever is needed to enhance
the functionality of SquirrelMail. The places where plugin code can be executed
are called "hooks".

There are some limitations with what these hooks can do. It is difficult to use
them to change the layout and to change functionality that already is in
SquirrelMail.

<sect2>The implementation<label id="plugin_implementation">
<p>
The plugin start point in the main SquirrelMail code is in the file
<tt>functions/plugin.php</tt>. In places where hooks are made available, they
are executed by calling one of the hook functions. The hook function then
traverses the array <tt/$squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['hookname']/ and executes all
the functions that are named in that array. Those functions are placed there
when plugins register themselves with SquirrelMail as discussed below. A plugin
may add its own internal functions to this array under any hook name provided by
the SquirrelMail developers.

A plugin must reside in a subdirectory of the <tt>plugins/</tt> directory. The
name of the subdirectory is considered to be the name of the plugin. Note that
the plugin will not function correctly if this is not the case.

A plugin is registered with SquirrelMail by using the configuration utility
or by manually editing the SquirrelMail configuration file. When adding a
plugin manually, its name (its directory name) must be added to the
<tt/$plugins/ array in <tt/config.php/ like this:

<tscreen><verb>
$plugins[] = 'plugin_name';
</verb></tscreen>

<label id="plugin_registration">When a plugin is registered, the file
<tt>plugins/plugin_name/setup.php</tt> is loaded and the function
<tt/squirrelmail_plugin_init_&lt;plugin_name&gt;()/ is called with no parameters.
That function is where the plugin may register itself against any hooks it
wishes to take advantage of.

As of SquirrelMail 1.5.2, the <tt>plugins/plugin_name/setup.php</tt> file is
parsed at <it/configuration/ time instead of at run time as a performance
enhancement. The resultant <tt/$squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['hookname']/ array
is then stored statically in the SquirrelMail <tt/config/ directory in a file
called <tt/plugin_hooks.php/. Plugin authors should keep in mind that when
making changes to the hook structure of their plugins, they will need to
re-run the SquirrelMail configuraion utility or manually edit
<tt/plugin_hooks.php/ before the changes will take effect.

TODO: Add a description on how to manually create the file <tt/plugin_hooks.php/, i.e. without using the Perl script. Perl is not a requisite.

<sect1>The starting point
<sect2>Plugin initialization<label id="plugin_setup_file">
<p>
All plugins must contain a file called <tt/setup.php/ and must include a
function called <tt/squirrelmail_plugin_init_&lt;plugin_name&gt;()/ therein.
Since including numerous plugins can slow SquirrelMail's performance
considerably, the <tt/setup.php/ file should contain little else. Any functions
that are registered against plugin hooks should do little more than call another
function in a different file. No other files should be included in the global
scope of <tt/setup.php/, as this defeats the purpose of keeping it streamlined.

Any other files used by the plugin should also be placed in the plugin directory
(or a subdirectory thereof) and should contain the bulk of the plugin logic.

The function <tt/squirrelmail_plugin_init_&lt;plugin_name&gt;()/ is called to
initalize a plugin as explained <ref id="plugin_registration" name="above">. This
function could look something like this (if the plugin was named "demo" and
resided in the directory <tt>plugins/demo/</tt>):

<label id="plugin_init_example"><tscreen><verb>
/**
 * Register this plugin with SquirrelMail
 *
 */
function squirrelmail_plugin_init_demo() {
    global $squirrelmail_plugin_hooks;

    $squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['optpage_register_block']['demo']
        = 'plugin_demo_options';
    $squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['login_cookie']['demo']
        = 'plugin_demo_login';
}
</verb></tscreen>

Again, please note that as of SquirrelMail 1.5.2, this function is no longer 
called at run time and is instead called (actually, it is only parsed, never
executed) only once at configuration time. Thus, the inclusion of any dynamic
code (anything except hook registration) here is strongly discouraged.

<sect2>Adding functionality
<p>
In the example <ref id="plugin_init_example" name="above">, the "demo" plugin
should also have two other functions in its <tt/setup.php/ file called
<tt/plugin_demo_options()/ and <tt/plugin_demo_login()/. The first of these
might look something like this:

<tscreen><verb>
/**
 * Add link to the Demo options page on the SquirrelMail
 * main options page listing
 *
 */
function plugin_demo_options() {
    include_once(SM_PATH . 'plugins/demo/functions.php');
    plugin_demo_options_do();
}
</verb></tscreen>

The function called <tt/plugin_demo_options_do()/ in the file
<tt>plugins/demo/functions.php</tt> contains the plugin's core logic for the
<tt/optpage_register_block/ hook. Aside from <tt/plugin_demo_options()/ and
<tt/plugin_demo_login()/ and the
<ref id="plugin_version_reporting" name="version reporting information explained below">,
there should be little-to-nothing else in <tt/setup.php/.

<sect1>Hooks
<p>
In the example <ref id="plugin_init_example" name="above">, the "demo" plugin
uses two "hooks" called "optpage_register_block" and "login_cookie". Which
hooks a plugin uses depends on what kind of functionality is being
implemented - where in the SquirrelMail source code does the plugin need to
execute its own code?

Hooks themselves are functions executed by the SquirrelMail core using one of
just a few hook types which in turn pass execution to the plugins that have 
registered themselves against the current hook as explained
<ref id="plugin_implementation" name="above">.

When executed, hooks are called with differing parameters and may or may not
take return values, all depending on the type of hook being called and the
context in which it is being used. On the source side (where the hook call
originates), all hooks have at least one parameter, which is the name of the
hook. After that, things (sometimes) get complicated.

<sect2>Hook types, parameters and return values
<p>
The design of each of the hook types has changed somewhat starting with
SquirrelMail version 1.5.2, so we provide a description of the hook types for
both the 1.4 release series and versions starting with 1.5.2. Despite the
differences noted here, in most cases, plugins will run on the same hook
without the need for version-specific code in either environment (however,
there are other differences that do require version-specific code, which are
explained elsewhere).

<descrip>

<tag>SquirrelMail 1.5.2+ uses three hook functions: <tt/do_hook()/,
<tt/concat_hook_function()/, and <tt/boolean_hook_function()/.</tag>

The <tt/do_hook()/ function is the most common do-all hook in the SquirrelMail
core. It provides all plugins a single parameter which is passed through the
hook by reference, so, if a plugin also accepts it by reference, it can be
changed as needed (and it is often an array of multiple values of interest to
plugins using a particular hook: take a look in the core - the second argument
to the <tt/do_hook/ call is what is passed along to the plugins). There is a
second parameter given to plugins, but it is not normally used: it is the
current value of the ultimate hook return value. All plugins are responsible
for sharing the creation/modification of whatever <tt/do_hook/ returns. The
ultimate return value is whatever the <it/last/ plugin returns from its hook
implementation, but if it does return something, it should be sure to check
if there was already a return value created by other plugins, which is what is
given as the second parameter to the plugin. As with all hooks, the usage of
the hook parameters and/or its return value are determined based on the
context in which the hook is used - you have to look at it in the SquirrelMail
core. Please remember NEVER to output any HTML directly during hook execution.

Read more about the <tt/do_hook()/ function in the
<url url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/devel-code/squirrelmail/_functions---plugin.php.html#functiondo_hook" name="1.5 API documentation">.

The <tt/concat_hook_function()/ is used in places where the SquirrelMail
core needs to aggregate return data from all plugins on the same hook.
Plugins are provided with the same (modifyable) parameter as with <tt/do_hook/.
In some places, the core will expect all plugins to return strings, which will
be concatenated together and returned to the SquirrelMail core. In other cases,
arbitrary values are used by the core, which will be placed into an array of
return values. What kind of return value is expected is best determined by
inspecting the core where the hook is called. Please remember NEVER to output
any HTML directly during hook execution.

Read more about the <tt/concat_hook_function()/ function in the
<url url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/devel-code/squirrelmail/_functions---plugin.php.html#functionconcat_hook_function" name="1.5 API documentation">.

The <tt/boolean_hook_function()/ allows plugins to vote for a specified action.
What that action is is entirely dependent on how the hook is used in the
SquirrelMail core (look for yourself). Plugins make their vote by returning a
boolean <tt/TRUE/ or <tt/FALSE/ value. This hook may be configured to tally
votes in one of three ways. This configuration is done with the third parameter
in the hook call in the core:

<itemize>
  <item>&gt; 0 -- At least one <tt/TRUE/ will override all <tt/FALSE/.
  <item>&lt; 0 -- At least one <tt/FALSE/ will override all <tt/TRUE/.
  <item>= 0 -- Majority wins. Any ties are broken with the last parameter in the
        hook call.
</itemize>

Plugins using <tt/boolean_hook_function/ are provided with the same
(modifyable) parameter as with <tt/do_hook/. Please remember NEVER to output
any HTML directly during hook execution.

Read more about the <tt/boolean_hook_function()/ function in the
<url url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/devel-code/squirrelmail/_functions---plugin.php.html#functionboolean_hook_function" name="1.5 API documentation">.

<tag>SquirrelMail 1.4 uses four hook functions: <tt/do_hook()/, <tt/do_hook_function()/,
<tt/concat_hook_function()/, and <tt/boolean_hook_function()/.</tag>

The <tt/do_hook()/ function is a simple function that allows injecting of
custom output or override of default interface data. It doesn't pass any
data and doesn't ask for anything back. A limited number of <tt/do_hook()/
calls do pass some extra parameters, in which case your plugin may modify
the given data if you do so by reference. It is not necessary to return
anything from your function in such a case; modifying the parameter data
by reference is what does the job (although the hook call itself (in the
SquirrelMail core) must grab the return value for this to work). Note that
in this case, the one and only parameter to your hook function will be an
array, the first element simply being the hook name, followed by any other
parameters that may have been included in the actual hook call in the core.
Modify parameters with care!

Read more about the <tt/do_hook()/ function in the
<url url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/stable-code/squirrelmail/_functions---plugin.php.html#functiondo_hook" name="1.4 API documentation">

The <tt/do_hook_function()/ was intended to be the main hook type used when the
source needs to get something back from your plugin. It is somewhat limited in
that it will only use the value returned from the <it/last/ plugin registered
against the hook. The SquirrelMail core might use the return value for this hook
type for internal purposes, or might expect you to provide text or HTML to be
sent to the client browser (you'll have to look at its use in context to
understand how you should return values here). The parameters that your hook
function gets will be anything you see <it/after/ the hook name in the actual
hook call in the source. These cannot be changed in the same way that the
<tt/do_hook()/ parameters can be.

Read more about the <tt/do_hook_function()/ function in the
<url url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/stable-code/squirrelmail/_functions---plugin.php.html#functiondo_hook_function" name="1.4 API documentation">

The <tt/concat_hook_function()/ fixes some shortcomings of the
<tt/do_hook_function()/ in that it uses the return values of all plugins
registered against the hook. In order to do so, the return value is assumed to
be a string, which is just piled (concatenated) on top of whatever it got from
the other plugins working on the same hook. Again, you'll have to inspect the
source code to see how such data is put to use, but most of the time, it is
used to create a string of HTML to be inserted into the output page. The
parameters that your hook function will get are the same as for the
<tt/do_hook_function/; they are anything <it/after/ the hook name in the
actual hook call in the source.

Read more about the <tt/concat_hook_function()/ function in the
<url url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/stable-code/squirrelmail/_functions---plugin.php.html#functionconcat_hook_function" name="1.4 API documentation">

The <tt/boolean_hook_function()/ allows plugins to vote for a specified action.
What that action is is entirely dependent on how the hook is used in the
SquirrelMail core (look for yourself). Plugins make their vote by returning a
boolean <tt/TRUE/ or <tt/FALSE/ value. This hook may be configured to tally
votes in one of three ways. This configuration is done with the third parameter

  <item>= 0 -- Majority wins. Any ties are broken with the last parameter in the
        hook call.
</itemize>

Each plugin registered on such a hook will receive the second paramter in the
hook call in the core as its one and only parameter (this might be an array if
multiple values need to be passed).

This is a list of all hooks currently available in SquirrelMail, ordered by
file.

TODO: Update this list. (especially in 1.5.2, we are removing a great number of hooks to be replaced with the template_construct_&lt;template&gt; hook)

TODO: Reduce list of hooks by grouping them into separate chapters.

TODO: List is very out-of-synch with newest 1.5.2 and all its changes, as is the rest of the plugin documentation... much needs to be re-written

<sect2>The address book hooks
<p>
SquirrelMail 1.4.5 and 1.5.1 introduced two hooks that allow custom address book
backends. These hooks are placed in <tt>functions/addressbook.php</tt> file.
The <tt/abook_add_class/ hook is a simple hook designed to load custom address
book classes before any other code is loaded. The <tt/abook_init/ hook allows to
modify the <tt/$abook/ object that represents the configured address books. The
hook is executed after the initiation of the local address book backends (file
and DB based ones) and before the remote (LDAP) backend init. The second
<tt/abook_init/ argument stores the address book object, and the third argument
stores the return value of the <tt/$abook-&gt;add_backend()/ method.

<sect2>The attachment hooks
<p>
When a message has attachments, this hook is called for each attachment according
to its MIME type. For instance, a ZIP file will trigger a hook call to a hook
named "attachment application/x-zip". A plugin registered on such a hook typically 
will show a link to do a specific action, such as "Verify" or "View" for a ZIP 
file. Thus, to register your plugin for ZIP attachments, you'd do this in
<tt>setup.php</tt> (assuming your plugin is called "demo"):

<tscreen><verb>
$squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['attachment application/x-zip']['demo'] =
    'demo_handle_zip_attachment';
</verb></tscreen>

This is a breakdown of the data passed in the array to the hook that is called:

<tscreen><verb>
[0] = An array of links for actions (see below) (alterable).
[1] = The message index of the first message on the message list page within 
      which the current message is found (startMessage). Can be used herein 
      for building URLs that point to the correct message list page.
[2] = The ID of the current message (id). Can be used herein to build URLs 
      that point to the correct message.
[3] = The mailbox name, encoded with urlencode() (urlMailbox). Can be used
      herein to build URLs that point to the correct message list page.
[4] = The entity ID of the attachment inside the mail message (ent). Can 
      be used herein to build URLs that point to the correct attachment.
[5] = The default URL to go to when the filename is clicked upon (alterable,
      but only one URL is allowed, thus, the last plugin to execute for
      the current attachment wins out - usually it's better to just add a
      new action to array element 1 above).
[6] = The filename that is displayed for the attachment.
[7] = The "where" criteria that was used to find the current message (where)
      (only applicable when the message was in fact found using a search). 
      Can be used herein to build URLs that point to the correct message list 
      page.
[8] = The "what" criteria that was used to find the current message (what) 
      (only applicable when the message was in fact found using a search).
      Can be used herein to build URLs that point to the correct message list
      page.
</verb></tscreen>

To set up links for actions, add them to the array data passed in to the hook
like this:

<tscreen><verb>
$args[0]['&lt;plugin_name&gt;']['href'] = 'link URL';
$args[0]['&lt;plugin_name&gt;']['text'] = _("Text to display");
$args[0]['&lt;plugin_name&gt;']['extra'] =
    'extra stuff, such as an &lt;img ...&gt; tag (will be part of the clickable link)';
</verb></tscreen>

Note: The syntax of <tt/_("Text to display")/ is explained in the section about
internationalization.

You can leave the <tt/text/ empty and put an image tag in <tt/extra/ to show an
image-only link for the attachment, or do the opposite (leave <tt/extra/ empty)
to display a text-only link.

It's also possible to specify a hook as "attachment type0/*", for example
"attachment text/*". This hook will be executed whenever there's no more
specific rule available for that type.

There is also an "attachment */*" hook for plugins that want to handle any
and all attachments, regardless of their mime types. Please use conservatively.

Putting all this together, the <tt/demo_handle_zip_attachment()/ function should
look like this (note how the argument is being passed):

<tscreen><verb>
function demo_handle_zip_attachment(&ero;$args) {
    include_once(SM_PATH . 'plugins/demo/functions.php');
    demo_handle_zip_attachment_do($args);
}
</verb></tscreen>

And the <tt/demo_handle_zip_attachment_do()/ function in the
<tt>plugins/demo/functions.php</tt> file would typically (but not necessarily)
display a custom link:

<tscreen><verb>
function demo_handle_zip_attachment_do(&ero;$args) {
    bindtextdomain('demo', SM_PATH . 'locale');
    textdomain('demo');

    $args[0]['demo']['href'] = SM_PATH . 'plugins/demo/zip_handler.php?' .
        'passed_id=' . $args[2] . '&ero;mailbox=' . $args[3] .
        '&ero;passed_ent_id=' . $args[4];
    $args[0]['demo']['text'] = _("Show zip contents");

    bindtextdomain('squirrelmail', SM_PATH . 'locale');
    textdomain('squirrelmail');
}
</verb></tscreen>

Note that the text domain has to be changed to properly translate the link text.

The file <tt>plugins/demo/zip_handler.php</tt> can now do whatever it needs with
the attachment (note that the link will hand information about how to retrieve the
source message from the IMAP server as GET varibles).

<sect2>The compose form hook
<p>
The <tt/compose_form/ hook allows plugins to insert their own code into the form
tag for the main message composition HTML form. Usually plugins will want to
insert some kind of code in an <tt/onsubmit/ event handler. In order to allow
more than one plugin to do so, all plugins using this hook to add some
<tt/onsubmit/ code need to add that code (without the enclosing attribute name
and quotes) as a new array entry to the global <tt/$compose_onsubmit/ array. The
code should use "return false" if the plugin has found a reason to stop form
submission, otherwise it should <it/do nothing/ (that is, please do not use
"return true", as that will prevent other plugins from using the <tt/onsubmit/
handler). SquirrelMail itself will insert a final "return true". All
<tt/onsubmit/ code will be enclosed in double quotes by SquirrelMail, so plugins
need to quote accordingly if needed. For example:

<tscreen><verb>
global $compose_onsubmit;
$compose_onsubmit[] = ' if (somevar == \'no\') return false; ';
</verb></tscreen>

Note the escaped single quotes. If you use double quotes, they would have to be
escaped as such:

<tscreen><verb>
global $compose_onsubmit;
$compose_onsubmit[] = ' if (somevar == \'no\') { alert(\\"Sorry\\"); return false; }';
</verb></tscreen>

Any other form tag additions by a plugin (beside <tt/onsubmit/ event code) can
currently be echoed directly to the browser.

<sect2>The configuration testing hook
<p>
SquirrelMail has a script called <tt/configtest.php/ which can be used to test
the SquirrelMail configuration. Since SquirrelMail 1.5.2, the configtest script
includes the <tt/configtest/ hook. The hook uses the boolean hook function call.
Plugins that are attached to this hook should return a boolean <tt/TRUE/ if
they detect any errors in the plugin's configuration. Verbose messages can be
printed with a <tt/do_err('error message', FALSE)/ function call or with any
standard PHP inline output function.

The configtest script is executed in an anonymous, unauthenticated environment, so
username and password information isn't available as it would be in all other 
SquirrelMail scripts. Only a limited set of functions are loaded. The 
<tt/do_err()/ function is a special configtest script
function, which is used to print error messages. If a plugin uses the
<tt/do_err()/ function, it is recommended to set the second function argument to
<tt/FALSE/ even on fatal errors. The configuration testing will stop on a fatal
error, that is, if the hook call returns a boolean <tt/TRUE/, and it's best to
let the script continue checking for other system configuration problems.

<sect2>The identity hooks
<p>
This set of hooks allows plugins to add options to the SquirrelMail identity
preferences.

This set of hooks is passed special information in the array of arguments:

<descrip>

<tag/options_identities_process/
This hook is called at the top of the "Identities" page, which is most useful
when the user has changed any identity settings. This is where you'll want to
save any custom information you are keeping for each identity or catch any
custom submit buttons that you may have added to the identities page. In
SquirrelMail 1.4.4 or older, and in 1.5.0, the arguments to this hook are:

<tscreen><verb>
[0] = hook name (always "options_identities_process")
[1] = should I run the <tt/SaveUpdateFunction()/ (alterable)
</verb></tscreen>

By default, <tt/SaveUpdateFunction()/ isn't called. If you want to trigger it,
you have to set the second array element to <tt/1/ or <tt/TRUE/.

Since SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and 1.5.1, the arguments to this hook are:

<tscreen><verb>
[0] = hook name (always "options_identities_process")
[1] = action (hook is used only in 'update' action and any custom
      action added to form with option_identities_table and
      option_identities_buttons hooks)
[2] = processed identity number
</verb></tscreen>

This hook isn't available in SquirrelMail 1.4.5.

<tag/options_identities_renumber/
This hook is called when one of the identities is being renumbered. If a user
has three identities and deletes the second, this hook would be called with an
array that looks like this: <tt/('options_identities_renumber', 2, 1)/. The
arguments to this hook are:

<tscreen><verb>
[0] = hook name (always "options_identities_renumber")
[1] = being renumbered from ('default' or 1 through (# idents) - 1)
[2] = being renumbered to ('default' or 1 through (# idents) - 1)
</verb></tscreen>

This hook isn't available in SquirrelMail 1.4.5, and the renumbering order
differs since 1.4.5 and 1.5.1.

<tag/options_identities_table/
This hook allows you to insert additional rows into the table that holds each
identity. The arguments to this hook are:

<tscreen><verb>
[0] = additional HTML attributes applied to table row.
      use it like this in your plugin:
         &lt;tr "&lt;?php echo $args[0]; ?&gt;"&gt;
[1] = is this an empty section (the one at the end of the list)?
[2] = what is the 'post' value? (ident # or empty string if default)
</verb></tscreen>

You need to return any HTML you would like to add to the table. You could add a
table row with code similar to this:

<tscreen><verb>
function demo_identities_table(&ero;$args) {
    return '&lt;tr bgcolor="' . $args[0] . '"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&ero;nbsp;&etago;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;' .
        'YOUR CODE HERE' . '&etago;td&gt;&etago;tr&gt;' . "\n";
}
</verb></tscreen>

The first hook argument was modified in 1.4.5 and 1.5.1. In SquirrelMail
1.4.1-1.4.4 and 1.5.0i, the argument only contains the background color. You
should use <tt/&lt;tr bgcolor="&lt;?php echo $args[0]; ?&gt;"&gt;/ in these
SquirrelMail versions.

<tag/options_identities_buttons/
This hook allows you to add a button (or other HTML) to the row of buttons under
each identity. The arguments to this hook are:

<tscreen><verb>
[0] = is this an empty section (the one at the end of the list)?
[1] = what is the 'post' value? (ident # or empty string if default)
</verb></tscreen>

You need to return any HTML you would like to add here. You could add a button
with code similar to this:

<tscreen><verb>
function demo_identities_button(&ero;$args) {
    return '&lt;input type="submit" name="demo_button_' . $args[1] .
        '" value="Press Me" /&gt;';
}
</verb></tscreen>

Since SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and 1.5.1, the <tt/input/ element should use a
<tt/smaction[action_name][identity_no]/ value in the <tt/name/ attribute if you
want to process your button actions in the <tt/options_identity_process/ hook.

</descrip>

<sect2>The preference hooks
<p>
These hooks are used when you want to add preferences to existing preference
pages. See <ref id="preferences" name="Preferences">.

<sect2>Requesting new hooks
<p>
It's impossible for the SquirrelMail team to foresee all of the places where 
hooks might be useful, so you might need to negotiate the insertion of a new 
hook to make your plugin work. Start by writing a patch which will insert the 
hook you want to add, and mail your request (with the patch attached) to the 
SquirrelMail development mailing list. Don't forget to explain the need for the 
new hook in your message.

<sect1>Preferences<label id="preferences">
<p>
Before you start adding user preferences to your plugin, please take a moment to
think about it: in some cases, more preferences may not be a good thing. Having
too many preferences can be confusing. Thinking from the user's perspective,
will the proposed preferences actually be used? Will users understand what these
preferences are for? Consider this carefully.

If you decide that more preferences really are needed for your plugin, there are
two ways to add them. When there's only a few preferences that doesn't merit an
entirely new preferences page, you can incorporate them as a section in an
existing SquirrelMail preference section ("Personal Information", "Display
Preferences", "Message Highlighting", "Folder Preferences", or "Index Order").
If there's an extensive number of preferences, a separate page might be needed.
There may also be other reasons to create a separate page for the user to
interact with.

<sect2>Adding preferences to an existing page
<p>
There are two ways to accomplish the integration of your plugin's settings into
another preferences page. The first, and preferred, way to add preferences to an
existing preference page is to use one of the <tt/"optpage_loadhook_&lt;pref
page&gt;/ hooks. The <tt/sent_subfolders/ plugin has an excellent example of
this method. Briefly, this way of adding preferences consists of adding some
plugin-specific information to a predefined data structure which SquirrelMail
then uses to build the HTML input forms for you.

As an example, we'll use the <tt/optpage_loadhook_display/ hook to add a new
group of preferences to the display preferences page. First, we inform
SquirrelMail that we want to use this hook by adding a line to the
<tt/squirrelmail_plugin_init_demo()/ function in
<tt>plugins/demo/setup.php</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
$squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['optpage_loadhook_display']['demo'] = 'demo_options';
</verb></tscreen>

Make sure that the function <tt/demo_options()/ calls another function, located
elsewhere, called <tt/demo_options_do()/. The <tt/demo_options()/ function needs
to add a new key to two arrays: <tt/$optpage_data['grps']/ and
<tt/$optpage_data['vals']/. The value associated with the key in
<tt/$optpage_data['grps']/ should simply be the plugin's section heading at the
preferences page, and the value associated with the key in
<tt/$optpage_data['vals']/ an array with all the plugin's preferences. (Yes,
that's four levels of nested arrays.) The specified preference attributes are
used by SquirrelMail to build the HTML input elements automatically. This
example includes just one input element, a <tt/select/ (drop-down) list:

<tscreen><verb>
function demo_options_do() {
    global $optpage_data;
    $optpage_data['grps']['demo'] = _("Demo Options");
    $optionValues = array();
    $optionValues[] = array(
        'name'    =&gt; 'plugin_demo_favorite_color',
        'caption' =&gt; _("Please choose your favorite color"),
        'type'    =&gt; SMOPT_TYPE_STRLIST,
        'refresh' =&gt; SMOPT_REFRESH_ALL,
        'posvals' =&gt; array(0 =&gt; _("red"),
                           1 =&gt; _("blue"),
                           2 =&gt; _("green"),
                           3 =&gt; _("orange")),
        'save'    =&gt; 'save_plugin_demo_favorite_color'
    );
    $optpage_data['vals']['demo'] = $optionValues;
}
</verb></tscreen>

The array used to specify each plugin preference has the following possible
attributes:

<descrip>

<tag><tt/name/</tag>
The preference name, used both as a key when saving the preferences and as the
input element name.

<tag><tt/caption/</tag>
The text that prefaces this preference.

<tag><tt/trailing_text/ (optional)</tag>
A text that follows a text input or a select list. This is useful for
indicating units, meanings of special values, etc.

<tag><tt/type/</tag>
The type of input element, which should be one of:
<itemize>
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_STRING/</tt> for a string/text.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_STRLIST/</tt> for a select list.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_TEXTAREA/</tt> for a text area.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_INTEGER/</tt> for an integer.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_FLOAT/</tt> for a floating point number.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_BOOLEAN/</tt> for a boolean (yes/no) radio buttons.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_HIDDEN/</tt> for a hidden input (not actually shown on preferences page).
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_COMMENT/</tt> for a showing the text specified by the <tt/comment/ attribute, but no user input is needed.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_FLDRLIST/</tt> for a select list of IMAP folders.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_TYPE_FLDRLIST_MULTI/</tt> for a select list of IMAP folders where the user can select more than one folder.
</itemize>

<tag><tt/refresh/ (optional)</tag>
Indicates if a link should be shown to refresh part or all of the window after
saving. Possible values are:
<itemize>
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_REFRESH_NONE/</tt> doesn't show a refresh link.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_REFRESH_FOLDERLIST/</tt> shows a link for refreshing the folder list.
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_REFRESH_ALL/</tt> shows a link for refreshing the entire window.
</itemize>

<tag><tt/initial_value/</tag>
The value that should initially be placed in this input element.

<tag><tt/posvals/</tag>
For select lists, this should be an associative array where each key is an
actual input value and the corresponding value is what is displayed to the user
for that list item in the drop-down list.

<tag><tt/save/</tag>
You may indicate that special functionality needs to be used instead of just
saving this setting by giving the name of a function to call when this value
would otherwise just be saved in the user's preferences.

<tag><tt/size/</tag>
Specifies the size of certain input elements (typically textual inputs).
Possible values are:
<itemize>
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_SIZE_TINY/</tt>
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_SIZE_SMALL/</tt>
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_SIZE_MEDIUM/</tt>
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_SIZE_LARGE/</tt>
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_SIZE_HUGE/</tt>
  <item><tt><bf/SMOPT_SIZE_NORMAL/</tt>
</itemize>

<tag><tt/comment/</tag>
For <tt/SMOPT_TYPE_COMMENT/ type preferences, this is the text displayed to the
user.

<tag><tt/extra_attributes/</tag>
This is where you may add any additional JavaScript or other attributes to the 
preference element. The value of this setting should be an array, where the 
keys of the array are the attribute names as you expect them to show up in the
resulting HTML, and the values are the corresponding attribute values. For 
example, you could add an "onchange" JavaScript handler to a drop-down list:

<tscreen><verb>
    $optpage_data['vals'][1][] = array(
        'extra_attributes' =&gt; array('onchange' =&gt; 'alert("Thank you for changing the drop-down list!");'),
        ...
</verb></tscreen>

<tag><tt/post_script/</tag>
You may specify some script (usually JavaScript) that will be placed after
(outside of) the input element.

<tag><tt/htmlencoded/</tag>
Disables HTML sanitizing. Don't disable the sanitizing if user input is
possible, unless your plugin uses its own sanitizing functions. Currently only
works with <tt/SMOPT_TYPE_STRLIST/.

<tag><tt/folder_filter/</tag>
Controls folder list limits in <tt/SMOPT_TYPE_FLDRLIST/ widget. See the
<tt/$flag/ argument in the <tt/sqimap_mailbox_option_list()/ function.
Available since 1.5.1.

</descrip>

Note that you do not have to create a whole new section at the preferences page
if you merely want to add a simple input item or two to a preferences section
that already exists. For example, the "Display Options" page has these groups:

<tscreen><verb>
0 - "General Display Options"
1 - "Mailbox Display Options"
2 - "Message Display and Composition"
</verb></tscreen>

To add our previous input drop-down to the "Mailbox Display Options", don't
create your own group - just add it to the existing one.

<tscreen><verb>
function demo_options_do() {
    global $optpage_data;
    $optpage_data['vals'][1][] = array(
        'name'    =&gt; 'plugin_demo_favorite_color',
        'caption' =&gt; _("Please choose your favorite color"),
        'type'    =&gt; SMOPT_TYPE_STRLIST,
        'refresh' =&gt; SMOPT_REFRESH_ALL,
        'posvals' =&gt; array(0 =&gt; _("red"),
                           1 =&gt; _("blue"),
                           2 =&gt; _("green"),
                           3 =&gt; _("orange")),
        'save'    =&gt; 'save_plugin_demo_favorite_color'
    );
}

</verb></tscreen>

If you indicated a <tt/save/ attribute for any of your preferences, you must
create that function (you'll only need to do this if you need to do some special
processing for one of your settings). The function gets one parameter, which is
an object with mostly the same attributes you defined when you made the
preference above. The <tt/new_value/ (and possibly <tt/value/, which is the
current value for this setting) is the most useful attribute in this context:

<tscreen><verb>
function save_plugin_demo_favorite_color($option) {
    // if user chose orange, make note that they are really dumb
    if ($option-&gt;new_value == 3) {
        // more code here as needed
    }

    // don't even save this setting if user chose green (old setting will remain)
    if ($option-&gt;new_value == 2) {
        return;
    }

    // for all other colors, save as normal
    save_option($option);
}
</verb></tscreen>

The second, deprecated, legacy method is to add the HTML code for your
preferences directly to the preferences page of your choice. Although currently
very popular, avoid it if you can. That said, here is how it works. Look for any
of the hooks named as <tt/options_&lt;pref page&gt;_inside/, where &lt;pref
page&gt; is "display", "personal", etc. For this example, we'll use
<tt/options_display_inside/ and, as above, "demo" as our plugin name:

Inform SquirrelMail that we want to use this hook by adding a line to the
<tt/squirrelmail_plugin_init_demo()/ function in
<tt>plugins/demo/setup.php</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
$squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['options_display_inside']['demo'] = 'demo_show_options';
</verb></tscreen>

Note that there are also hooks such as <tt/options_display_bottom/, however,
they place your preferences at the bottom of the preferences page, which is
usually not desirable (mostly because they also come <it/after/ the closure of
the HTML <tt/form/ element). It is possible to use these hooks if you want to
create your own form with custom submission logic.

The function <tt/demo_show_options_do()/ should have output similar to this
(note that you will be inserting code into a table that is already defined with
two columns, so please be sure to keep this framework in your plugin):

<tscreen><verb>
     ------cut here-------
     &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
           OPTION_NAME
        &etago;td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
           OPTION_INPUT
        &etago;td&gt;
     &etago;tr&gt;
     ------cut here-------
</verb></tscreen>

Of course, you can place any text where "OPTION_NAME" is and any input tags
where "OPTION_INPUT" is.

You will want to use the <tt/options_&lt;pref page&gt;_save/ hook (in this case,
<tt/options_display_save/) to save the user's settings after they have pressed
the "Submit" button. Again, inform SquirrelMail that we want to use this hook by
adding a line to the <tt/squirrelmail_plugin_init_demo()/ function in
<tt>plugins/demo/setup.php</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
$squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['options_display_save']['demo'] = 'demo_save_options';
</verb></tscreen>

The function <tt/demo_save_options_do()/ should put the user's settings into
permanent storage (see <ref id="savepref" name="Saving and retrieving
preferences"> below for more information). This example assumes that in the
preferences page, the input element's <tt/name/ attribute was set to
"demo_option":

<tscreen><verb>
global $data_dir, $username;
sqgetGlobalVar('demo_option', $demo_option);
setPref($data_dir, $username, 'demo_option', $demo_option);
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Creating a custom preference page
<p>
It is also possible to create a custom preference page for a plugin. This is
particularly useful when the plugin has numerous preferences or needs to offer
special interaction with the user (for things such as changing password, etc.).
Here is an outline of how to do so (again, using the "demo" plugin name):

First of all you have to add a new listing to the main "Options page". Always
use the <tt/optpage_register_block/ hook where you create a simple array that
lets SquirrelMail build the HTML to add the plugin preferences entry
automatically. Inform SquirrelMail that we want to use this hook by adding a
line to the <tt/squirrelmail_plugin_init_demo()/ function in
<tt>plugins/demo/setup.php</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
$squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['optpage_register_block']['demo'] = 'demo_options_block';
</verb></tscreen>

Assuming the function <tt/demo_options_block()/ calls another function elsewhere
called <tt/demo_options_block_do()/, that function only needs to create a simple
array and add it to the <tt/$optpage_blocks/ array:

<tscreen><verb>
global $optpage_blocks;
bindtextdomain('demo', SM_PATH . 'locale');
textdomain('demo');
$optpage_blocks[] = array(
    'name' =&gt; _("Favorite Color Settings"),
    'url'  =&gt; SM_PATH . 'plugins/demo/options.php',
    'desc' =&gt; _("Change your favorite color and find new exciting colors"),
    'js'   =&gt; FALSE
);
bindtextdomain('squirrelmail', SM_PATH . 'locale');
textdomain('squirrelmail');
</verb></tscreen>

The array must have four elements:

<descrip>
<tag/name/
The title of the plugin's preference page as it will be displayed at the Options
page. Note that the text domain has to be changed to properly translate this text.
<tag/url/
The URI that points to your plugin's custom preferences page.
<tag/desc/
A description of what the preferences page offers the user. This is displayed at
the Options page below the title. Note that the text domain has to be changed to 
properly translate this text.
<tag/js/
Indicates if this preference page requires the client browser to be
JavaScript-capable. Should be <tt/TRUE/ or <tt/FALSE/.
</descrip>

The next step is to create your custom options page, keeping in mind the guidelines
in <ref id="pagescalleddirectly" name="pages called directly"> and possibly using 
the techniques described in <ref id="savepref" name="Saving and retrieving
preferences"> below. 

<sect2>Saving and retrieving preferences<label id="savepref">
<p>
TODO: Complete this section. (What happened to the text for this section from
plugin.txt?)

<sect1>Plugin pages called directly by the client browser<label id="pagescalleddirectly">
<p>
There are a few places in a plugin, such as when hooking into the "menuline" or 
"optpage_register_block" hooks, where you can provide a link to a file that is
called directly by the client browser. No matter what that page does, it should 
always validate that the calling client has a current login session. Thus, all
such pages should start with the following code:

<tscreen><verb>
/*
 * Pages that are called directly by the client browser need to load the
 * SquirrelMail framework. This differs between various SquirrelMail versions.
 * Plugins that don't support all SquirrelMail versions can strip some of this
 * code away.
 */
if (file_exists('../../include/init.php')) {
    /*
     * "include/init.php" is used since SquirrelMail 1.5.2. This isn't needed
     * for plugins that don't support SquirrelMail 1.5.2 and later.
     */
    include_once('../../include/init.php');
} elseif (file_exists('../../include/validate.php')) {
    /*
     * "include/validate.php" is used since SquirrelMail 1.4.0 until version
     * 1.5.1.
     */
    define('SM_PATH', '../../');
    include_once(SM_PATH . 'include/validate.php');
} else {
    /*
     * "src/validate.php" is used in SquirrelMail 1.2. This isn't needed for
     * plugins that don't support SquirrelMail 1.2.
     */
    chdir('..');
    define('SM_PATH', '../');
    include_once(SM_PATH . 'src/validate.php');
}
</verb></tscreen>

TODO: Possibly provide link to the include hierarchy provided by init.php/validate.php

<sect1>Configuration<label id="plugin_configuration">
<p>
It is common to need a configuration file that holds some variables that are
set up at install time. For ease of installation, maintenance and upgrades, all
behavioral settings should be placed in a configuration file that is isolated
from the rest of the plugin code. A typical file name to use is
<tt/config.php/. The plugin should allow the administrator to store this file
in either the plugin directory or in the main SquirrelMail configuration
directory, giving precedence to the latter. 

Plugins that make use of configuration files should <it/not/ include a file
called <tt/config.php/ in distribution packages; instead, a copy of that file
named <tt/config_example.php/ is desirable, since customized <tt/config.php/
files will not be lost upon upgrading the plugin. If the plugin does not need
environment-specific configuration settings, you may also consider including
a default configuration file so that the administrator does not need to
configure the plugin unless she wants to change some particular setting.
The usual default configuration file name is <tt/config_default.php/.

A plugin can try to be smart about where to find the needed configuration
file by doing something such as this:

<tscreen><verb>
if (!@include_once(SM_PATH . 'config/config_demo.php'))
   if (!@include_once(SM_PATH . 'plugins/demo/config.php'))
      @include_once(SM_PATH . 'plugins/demo/config_default.php');
</verb></tscreen>

If the plugin <it/must/ be configured specifically for the system upon which
it is installed, remove the third line in this example.

<sect1>Versioning
<sect2>Version numbering
<p>
In order to facilitate easier (and possibly automated) plugin management by 
system administrators as well as in-SquirrelMail functionality that enables
cross-plugin compatibility and communication, plugin versioning should remain 
consistent with that of SquirrelMail itself. While SquirrelMail does its
best to work with non-standard version strings, versioning such as that
explained in <ref id="versionformat" name="Version numbering">, with the 
possible addition of an applicable SquirrelMail version, is the best way 
to track your plugin's development (i.e., "1.0.4-1.4.5" or just "1.0.4").
Versions with only two digits ("1.0-1.4.5" or just "1.0") are also acceptable
(a third digit of zero is implied).

<sect2>Version reporting<label id="plugin_version_reporting">
<p>
The way any automated process gets its hands on the plugin version string
depends on the SquirrelMail version being used. As of SquirrelMail 1.5.2,
plugins should include an administrative function in <tt/setup.php/ that 
returns an array of details that describe the plugin, including its version 
number. The function must be named <tt/&lt;plugin name&gt;_info()/ and 
should return an associative array of version and requirements information.
Currently, at least the following elements are required, but the more 
information returned, the better.

<tabular ca="lll">
<bf/Element Name/|<bf/Explanation/|<bf/Example Values &amp; Notes/@
<tt/english_name/|Prettified plugin display name|"Demo Future Prediction" (can be different than the plugin's directory name)@
<tt/version/|Plugin version|"1.0", "2.5.1", etc.@
<tt/authors/|Plugin authors|An array of authors, where each author is described by a sub-array that is keyed by "email" and "sm&lowbar;site&lowbar;username" (the latter to be used at a later date). See below for an example.@
<tt/required_sm_version/|Minimum required SquirrelMail version|"1.2.8", "1.4.15", "1.5.2", etc.@
<tt/summary/|Functionality summary|This should be a brief sentence or two at the most.@
<tt/details/|Functionality details|This can be much more verbose compared to the <tt/summary/.@
<tt/requires_configuration/|Whether or not the plugin requires a configuration file to be prepared by the administrator|boolean <tt/0/ or <tt/1/.@
<tt/requires_source_patch/|Whether or not the plugin requires patching of the SquirrelMail source code|boolean <tt/0/ or <tt/1/ (or <tt/2/ to indicate that patching is optional (enables optional functionality) or is only required for some SquirrelMail versions, although the latter should be done in more detail using <tt/per_version_requirements/).

Other optional elements include:

<tabular ca="lll">
<bf/Element Name/|<bf/Explanation/|<bf/Example Values &amp; Notes/@
<tt/required_php_version/|Minimum required PHP version|"4.1.0", "4.4.8", "5.2.6", etc.@

<tt/required_functions/|List of required PHP functions|An array of function names needed by the plugin: <tt/array("recode_string", "ngettext", )/@
<tt/required_pear_packages/|List of required Pear packages|An array of Pear package names needed by the plugin: <tt/array("MDB2", "Cache_Lite", )/@
<tt/required_plugins/|List of other plugins that are required|An array of required plugins, where each plugin is described by a sub-array that is keyed by "version" (the minimum version of the plugin that is required) and "activate" (whether or not the plugin needs to be activated, or merely present in the plugins directory (as a code library)). Instead of the sub-array, the special constant <tt/SQ_INCOMPATIBLE/ may be used to indicate that this plugin is not compatible with the other. See below for an example.@
<tt/rpc/|List of RPC commands that this plugin answers to|A two-element array keyed by "commands" and "errors". Each of these contains a sub-array. The "commands" array is keyed by RPC command name, where corresponding values are the English explanations for what each command does. The "errors" array is keyed by each possible error number that the plugin's RPC interface might produce, where corresponding values are English explanations of what each error number means. <tt/array("commands" => array("demo_get_one_prediction" => "Peer into the crystal ball once"), "errors" => array(720 => "demo_get_one_prediction failed"),)/@
<tt/other_requirements/|Some other non-SquirrelMail or non-PHP requirements|<tt/"Courier Maildrop LDA"/@
<tt/external_project_uri/|Address of the project page or source code repository for the plugin|<tt>"http://example.org/my_plugin"</tt>@
<tt/per_version_requirements/|List of requirements this plugin has that are different based on the SquirrelMail version being used|An array which is keyed by SquirrelMail version numbers. Any version numbers skipped receive the same requirements laid out for the last version number that is listed below the skipped one. Each value is then a sub-array that may contain any of the requirement entries listed here, such as <tt/requires_source_patch/, <tt/required_plugins/, etc., or a special constant called <tt/SQ_INCOMPATIBLE/ (set the associated value to boolean <tt/1/), which indicates that the plugin is not compatible with the corresponding version of SquirrelMail. <tt/SQ_INCOMPATIBLE/ may also replace the entire sub-array for the incompatible SquirrelMail version, which is easier to understand. See below for an example.
</tabular>

A typical implementation of this function is as follows. Note that
this example shows a conditional requirement for the Compatibility
plugin that is due to the (required) use of <tt/sq_change_text_domain()/

          );

}
</verb></tscreen>

Prior to SquirrelMail 1.5.2, a function called
<tt>&lt;plugin name&gt;_version()</tt> was required. For the sake of
compatibility, it can be piggy-backed on top of the
<tt>&lt;plugin name&gt;_info()</tt> function very simply as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
/**
 * Returns version info about this plugin
 *
 */
function demo_version() {
   $info = demo_info();
   return $info['version'];
}
</verb></tscreen>

There is also a legacy version reporting mechanism that we would like plugin
authors to implement, since we are still in a transition period between the 
older and newer reporting usages. The now deprecated reporting mechanism  is to 
create a file called <tt/version/ in the plugin directory. That file should 
have only two lines: the first line should have the name of the plugin as 
named on the SquirrelMail web site (this is often a prettified version of the plugin
directory name), and the second line must have the version and nothing more. So
for our "demo" plugin, whose name on the web site might be something like "Demo
Future Prediction", the file <tt>plugins/demo/version</tt> should have these two
lines:

<tscreen><verb>
Demo Future Prediction
2.5.1
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Security considerations
<sect2>Calling external programs
<p>
All plugin authors should consider the security implications of their plugin.
Great care must always be taken if the plugin calls external programs, especially
ones that require set-uid permissions.

FIXME: more here about how to secure exec() calls with escapeshellarg() and named pipes method vs exec()


<sect2>Storing sensitive data
<p>
If a plugin needs to store sensitive user configuration files or other such data,
please consider extra steps to secure such files. One very easy way to do so is
to wrap all configuration files in PHP tags (and C-style block comments if the
configuration data is not PHP code itself):

<tscreen><verb>
<?php /*

# below is example non-PHP configuration 
# data that is secured from prying eyes

username_1 = admin
username_2 = super_admin

*/ ?>
</verb></tscreen>

Another approach is to store sensitive configuration data in SquirrelMail's 
own <tt/$data/ directory, since most system administrators (at least those who 
have read the installation instructions) know that the <tt/$data/ directory 
needs to be protected and (hopefully) have made sure that it has been.

Never store unsecured configuration data that contains any user or system-specific 
information in your plugin directory. Even the above suggestions
may not be sufficient depending on how sensitive the data is that you are 
storing. In such a situation, you might think about a more complex encryption
scheme such as the one provided by the <bf/vadmin/ plugin.

Note that just shipping unsecured configuration files along with a 
configuration file for Apache (<tt/.htaccess/) is not sufficient because 
not every system uses Apache as its web server.

<sect2>Disallowing access for diabled plugins
<p>

In some cases, it is also prudent to make sure that the plugin doesn't perform 
its function when it is not enabled. Any functions or files that contain PHP
code that is <tt/not/ wrapped inside a function can be protected from being
executed when the plugin is not activated by adding code similar to this:

<tscreen><verb>
if ( !is_plugin_enabled('my_plugin_name') ) {
    exit('The plugin my_plugin_name isn't enabled in the SquirrelMail configuration.');
}
</verb></tscreen>

Note, however, that sometimes <tt/other/ plugins can legitimately access a 
disabled plugin, so don't shoot yourself in the foot with too much protection.

<sect1>Coding tips<label id="plugin_coding_tips">
<p>
Listed below are several useful tips to keep in mind while coding plugins. Some of these items will be scrutinized and possibly treated as mandatory by the plugin team when evaluating new plugins.

<sect2>Knowing what hook is running
<p>
Some plugins may register the same function against multiple hooks or otherwise run the same library code for more than one hook. If that code needs to make a hook-specific decision, it can look at the global variable called <tt/$currentHookName/. However, this variable is only available in SquirrelMail versions 1.5.1 and above, so it is more portable to use the function <tt/get_current_hook_name()/, which is provided by the Compatibility plugin (see elsewhere for more information about using the Compatibility plugin[FIXME: provide a link for this]).

<sect1>Compatibility with older versions of SquirrelMail
<p>
Whenever new versions of SquirrelMail are released, there is always a
considerable lag time before it is widely adopted. During that transitional
time, especially when the new SquirrelMail version contains any architectural
and/or functional changes, plugin developers are put in a unique and very
difficult position. That is, there will be people running both the old and new
versions of SquirrelMail who want to use your plugin, and you will probably want
to accommodate them both.

One way to keep both sides happy is to keep two different versions of
your plugin up to date, one that runs under the older SquirrelMail, and one that
requires the newest SquirrelMail. This is inconvenient, however, especially if
you are continuing to develop the plugin. 

Depending on the changes implemented in the new SquirrelMail version, another
approach you may be able to use is to include code that can auto-sense the 
SquirrelMail version and make adjustments on the fly. There is a function called 
<tt/check_sm_version()/ available which does that. Read more about it in the 
<url
url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/stable-code/squirrelmail/_functions---global.php.html#functioncheck_sm_version"
name="stable"> and <url
url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/devel-code/squirrelmail/_functions---global.php.html#functioncheck_sm_version"
name="development"> API documentation.

Finally, there is a plugin called "Compatibility" that is intended to solve 
this problem without requiring any special coding on the part of plugin authors. 
Authors can develop one version of their plugin and seamlessly support any 
SquirrelMail version. Plugin code is typically developed against the newest 
SquirrelMail release, and users running older versions of SquirrelMail can 
use said plugin as long as they also have the "Compatibility" plugin. For 
more inforamtion, please download "Compatibility" and read its README file.

<sect1>Documentation files
<p>
Two more files are needed in your plugin directory. One file shall describes
your plugin and offers detailed instructions for configuration or help with
troubleshooting, etc. This file is usually entitled <tt/README/. Some useful
sections to include might be:

There are a few files that you should make sure to include when you build your
final plugin distribution.

<itemize>
  <item>Plugin name and author
  <item>Current version
  <item>Plugin features
  <item>Detailed plugin description
  <item>How-to for plugin configuration
  <item>Change log
  <item>Future ideas/enhancements/to do list
</itemize>

The other files shall explain how to install your plugin. This file is typically
called <tt/INSTALL/. If you do not require any special installation actions, you
can probably copy one from another plugin or use this as a template:

<tscreen><verb>
Installing the Demo plugin
==========================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory. Here is an example
   for the 1.0 version of the Demo plugin.

  cd plugins
  tar -zxvf demo-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the demo directory, copy "config.php.sample" to "config.php" and
   edit "config.php", making adjustments as you deem necessary. For more
   detailed explanations about each of these parameters, consult the README
   file.

      cd demo
      cp config.php.sample config.php
      vi config.php

3) Then go to your config directory and run "conf.pl". Choose option 8 and move
   the plugin from the "Available Plugins" category to the "Installed Plugins"
   category. Save and exit.

      cd ../../config/
      ./conf.pl

Upgrading the Demo plugin
=========================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory. Here is a example
   for the 3.1 version of the demo plugin.

  cd plugins
  tar -zxvf demo-3.1-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the demo directory, check your "config.php" file against the new
   version, to see if there are any new settings that you must add to your
   "config.php" file.

      diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your "config.php" file with the provided sample and
   reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the installation
   procedure above).
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Storing code
<p>
[FIXME: expand this section]
Due to the large number and wide range of functions plugins can cover it is
impractical to add all but the most popular of these to the SquirrelMail
core project.
There is a separate <url url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sm-plugins/"
name="SM Plugins"> project registered at SourceForge to house plugin code,
developers should consider joining this project.

<sect1>Additional Resources
<p>
In addition to this document, help writing plugins is easily obtained by posting
to the <url url="http://squirrelmail.org/docs/admin/admin-12.html#mailinglists"
name="SquirrelMail plugins mailing list">.

<sect1>How to release your plugin
<p>
As long as you've consulted the list of plugin standards and done your best to
follow them, there's little standing in the way of great fame as an official
SquirrelMail plugin developer.

First you have to make a distribution file. The file should be named
<tt/demo-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz/, where "demo" is the name of your plugin, "1.0" is
the version of your plugin, and "1.4.0" is the version of SquirrelMail required
to use your plugin.

You can create the distribution file in most *nix environments by running this
command from the plugins directory (NOT your plugin directory):

<tscreen><verb>
tar -czvf demo-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz demo
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Requirements Checklist
<p>
Make sure the plugin meets the SquirrelMail plugin requirements explained throughout this document. Here is a quick checklist to help summarize the various requirements.

<itemize>
  <item>FIXME: WHERE SHOULD THIS CHECKLIST BE BEST PLACED IN THIS DOCUMENT?
  <item>Keep <tt/setup.php/ <ref id="plugin_setup_file" name="small and efficient">
</itemize>

<sect2>Submitting the plugin
<p>
When the plugin is ready to be reviewed by the SquirrelMail plugin team, mail it
to the SquirrelMail plugin team members (who may be found by consulting the
<url url="http://www.squirrelmail.org/docs/devel/devel-1.html#ss1.2"
name="SquirrelMail team list">).

When the plugin is approved and you're granted access to upload it, all you have
to do is the actual uploading along with filling out some general information 
about the plugin and what it does.

<sect1>Release Instructions
<p>

<enum>
<item><bf/Teamwork:/ Before beginning, coordinate the release with other members of the admin list to ensure proper time for verification and testing of release components (RPM, etc).
<item><bf/Usual sanity:/ Check the code over to make sure we are absolutely ready.
<item><bf/Documentation:/ Update Release Documents
    <enum>
         <item> Make sure that the ChangeLog is up to date - remember to put the release date in place of <tt/SVN/ at the top of the file.
         <item> Update the ReleaseNotes, keeping the same general format.
         <item> Compose a three to eight line message you'll post to mailinglists and forums. Include links. (While you're at it, make a simple HTML version of it as well, you'll need it later) Be BRIEF. Keep this message in your editor or on file for later on.
    </enum>
<item><bf/Gearing up:/ Update the version number strings at 3 places:
    <enum>
         <item> Variables in <tt>functions/strings.php</tt> (<tt>$version = '1.2.1', $SQM_INTERNAL_VERSION=array(1,2,1)</tt>).
         <item> <tt>doc/ChangeLog</tt>
         <item> <tt>doc/ReleaseNotes</tt>
    </enum>
<item><bf/SVN packaging:/
    <enum>
         <item> Commit final changes to Subversion (doc/ChangeLog, doc/ReleaseNotes, functions/strings.php)
         <item> Tag SVN with the release number in the format rel-X_Y_Z (rel-1_2_1). Example:
            <tscreen>
svn copy https://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/squirrelmail/branches/SM-1_4-STABLE/squirrelmail \
    https://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/squirrelmail/tags/rel-1_2_1
            </tscreen>
         <item> Use the script <tt>make-release</tt> <url url="http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail/trunk/util/make-release" name="found in SVN"> under the <tt>util/</tt> dir. The only parameter
         is the version to release. It will download the tagged SVN copy, pack it up nicely and upload it to SF.net (CORRECTION - the upload commands are currently commented out, so you'll need to do that manually or edit the script to do that for you).
         You will need the following tools: bash, svn, ssh, curl, tar, gzip, zip, bzip2 and optionally rpmbuild.
         <item> Create a GPG signature for each of the newly created release packages. Typically, this can be done with:
             <enum>
                 <item><tt>gpg -a --detach-sign --output squirrelmail-X.Y.Z.tar.gz.sig squirrelmail-X.Y.Z.tar.gz</tt>
                 <item><tt>gpg -a --detach-sign --output squirrelmail-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2.sig squirrelmail-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2</tt>
                 <item><tt>gpg -a --detach-sign --output squirrelmail-X.Y.Z.zip.sig squirrelmail-X.Y.Z.zip</tt>
             </enum>
                An example for how to verify that your signature worked would be:
             <enum>
                 <item><tt>gpg --verify squirrelmail-X.Y.Z.tar.gz.sig squirrelmail-X.Y.Z.tar.gz</tt>
             </enum>
         <item> Upload the release files (including the md5, sha and GPG signatures) to Sourceforge.net, see <url url="http://alexandria.wiki.sourceforge.net/File+Release+System+-+Offering+Files+for+Download#upload" name="sf.net instructions">.
         <item> (huh: don't go to sleep before you're finished making the release)
     </enum>
<item><bf/Defrosting:/ Prepare SVN for continued development
    <enum>
         <item> Go back to your regular SVN development directory.
         <item> Update the version number variable in functions/strings.php by incrementing the incremental release number by 1 and adding <tt>' [SVN]'</tt> after it (<tt>$version = '1.2.2 [SVN]';</tt>).
         <item> Add a new section in doc/ChangeLog for the new release, followed by <tt>' - SVN'</tt>
         <item> Archive the doc/ReleaseNotes for this release like this:
         <tscreen>svn copy doc/ReleaseNotes doc/release_notes_archive/X.Y/Notes-X.Y.Z.txt</tscreen>
         <item> Commit all these changes to SVN with a note saying that it is ready for continued development.
    </enum>
<item><bf/sf.net admin stuff:/ Post the release files on SourceForge (you need to be a "release technician" to do this)
    <enum>
         <item> Create the new release of files

<sect1>Adding New Languages
<p>

<enum>
<item><bf/Validate the translation:/ Before beginning, there are several things
          that need to be verified for the translation to be acceptable:
    <enum>
         <item><bf/Copyright:/ Make sure it's OK to assign the copyright to the
                   SquirrelMail Project. We won't accept translations with other
                   copyright holders.
         <item><bf/Validate what was translated:/ The typical starting point for
                   translating the SquirrelMail core is the most recent 1.4.x
                   translation pack release <tt>squirrelmail.pot</tt> file, the most current
                   of which is found in SVN
                   <url url="http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail/branches/SM-1_4_15/locales/po/squirrelmail.pot?view=markup"
                   name="/branches/SM-1_4_15/locales/po">. However, the most
                   comprehensive list of strings (for both STABLE and DEVEL) is
                   always found in the SVN
                   <url url="http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail/trunk/locales/po/"
                   name="trunk locales">, which is also the starting point for making
                   new language pack releases.
         <item><bf/We want UTF-8:/ If the translation isn't already in UTF-8, push
                   very hard to have the translator convert to UTF-8. SquirrelMail
                   1.5.x will soon be UTF-only, in which case we will stop accepting
                   non-Unicode translations.
         <item><bf/Inspect headers/ Compare the translation headers to one of the
                   better ones already in the repository, such as Swedish
                   (<url url="http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail/trunk/locales/locale/sv_SE/LC_MESSAGES/squirrelmail.po?view=markup"
                   name="sv_SE">). Ask the translator to fix any problems with the
                   headers.
         <item><bf/We want two letter ISO 639-1:/ If the translator has chosen a
                   language code with attached region code, work with them to understand
                   if the region code is necessary. If at all possible, we want
                   languages with just the language code ("de" instead of "de_DE";
                   the latter is in the SquirrelMail repository only for legacy
                   reasons). Check other projects to get an idea of the region code
                   is needed such as <url url="http://l10n.kde.org/" name="KDE">,
                   <url url="http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/l10n-kde4/" name="KDE">,
                   Gnome, <url url="http://www.debian.org/international/l10n/po/"

                   <url url="http://translate.fedoraproject.org/languages" name="Fedora">,
                   Drupal, etc. Ideally, only the lower case two letter
                   <url url="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes"
                   name="ISO 639-1"> language code is used. If the region code is
                   needed, make sure the language code is lower case and the region
                   code is upper case ("pt_BR").
         <item><bf/Sanity check:/ Have a look over the translation file(s) and make
                   sure they look reasonable.
         <item><bf/sec_remove image:/ Ask for a translated copy of the
                   <tt><url url="http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail/trunk/squirrelmail/images/sec_remove_eng.png?view=markup"
                   name="sec_remove_eng.png"></tt> image file (renamed, of course, to
                   <tt>sec_remove_&lt;language&gt;.png</tt>).
         <item><bf/sec_remove strings:/ The <tt>sec_remove_eng.png</tt> string in the
                   <tt>squirrelmail.po</tt> file should be "translated" to
                   <tt>sec_remove_&lt;language&gt;.png</tt>. The string in the image itself
                   ("This image has been removed for security reasons") is also in
                   the <tt>.pot</tt> file and should be translated in the <tt>.po</tt> file.
   </enum>
<item><bf>Create <tt>setup.php</tt>:</bf> Each language has its own <tt>setup.php</tt> file found in
          the top-level language directory (alongside <tt>LC_MESSAGES</tt>). A good starting
          point is to look at an existing example such as the Norwegian
          (<url url="http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail/trunk/locales/locale/nb_NO/setup.php?view=markup"
          name="nb_NO">) one. See our <ref id="languages_array" name="explanation of

<item><bf/Place translations in SVN trunk:/ The main translations (<tt>.po</tt> files - <tt>.mo</tt>

          name="trunk/locales/locale">/&lt;language&gt;/LC_MESSAGES</tt>. There are two
          directories in the <tt>LC_MESSAGES</tt> directory for most languages: "plugins",
          which contains translations for plugins that are still coded such that
          translation files need to be placed within the plugin itself (obsolete).
          The "extra" directory contains other translation files for broken things
          (mostly plugins with missing or incorrect internationalization efforts).
          These all correspond to the <tt>.pot</tt> files we provide, so where the translated
          files go should be rather obvious. Properly coded plugin translation files
          belong in the top-level <tt>LC_MESSAGES</tt> directory.
<item><bf/sec_remove image:/ The translated sec_remove image file should be placed
          in the main
          <url url="http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail/trunk/locales/images/"
          name="locales images"> directory.
<item><bf/Update SourceForge:/ Add the language to the list of supported translations

<sect>Miscellaneous
<p>
TODO: This is a quick and dirty import of the documents in "/doc/Development".
They all need to be cleand up and in the LinuxDoc format.

<sect1>Addressbook internals
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
This document describes how the SquirrelMail address book works. It is
primarily intended for developers.


1. The Basics
-------------

The address book is written using PHP classes, with one class,
AddressBook, that use one or more "backend" classes to access
different address books.

All operations, such as search, lookup, add etc., are performed by
calling the appropriate methods from the AddressBook object. The
operation will then be distributed by calling the correct method in
the appropriate backend(s).

To initialize the address book, the function addressbook_init() from
functions/addressbook.php is called. This function will create an
AddressBook object, add one backend for a personal address book (file
based storage), and add the LDAP backends defined in the $ldap_server
configuration directive (if any).

An addressbook can also be initialized like this if you want to:

  $abook = new AddressBook;

  // Add one file based backend (personal address book)
  $abook->add_backend("local_file", Array("filename" => $filename,
                                          "create"   => true));

  $abook->add_backend("ldap_server", <array with parameters>);

  $res = $abook->search("John Doe");

  echo $res[0]["name"] . " " . $res[0]["email"];



2. The AddressBook class
------------------------

This class acts as the glue for the address book. The following public
methods are provided:

  add_backend(NAME, PARAMETERS)

     NAME - The name of the backend to add. A file with a
     class abook_NAME must be included before this can
     be done.

     PARAMETERS - A mixed variable that is passed on to
     the backend class constructor. See each backend
     for docs.

   This method will return a backend ID number (not usable at the
   moment), or false if it failed.


  search(QUERY, [BNUM])

     QUERY - Something to search for. At the moment, only
     a string is allowed here, but advanced expressions
     will be supported through an array of parameters.

     BNUM  - Optional backend number to search.

   This method will return an array of result arrays (see below), an
   empty array if nothing was found, or false if the search failed.


  s_search(QUERY, [BNUM])

   The same as search(), but the result array is sorted by backend and
   fullname before it is returned.


  lookup(NICKNAME, [BNUM])

     NICKNAME - Return the user identified by NICKNAME in
     the addressbook.

     BNUM - ID of the backend to look in (optional).

   This method will return one result array (see below), an empty
   array if nothing was found, or false if the search failed. The
   lookup is only performed in "local" type backends.


  list_addr()

   This method will return an array of result arrays (see below) for
   all addresses in the addressbook, or false if it failed. Only
   addresses in "local" type backends are returned.


  add(USERDATA, BNUM)

     USERDATA - An array with user data. Must contain the following
     keys: nickname, firstname, lastname, email, label
     See below for information about the keys.

     BNUM - ID of the backend, as returned by add_backend, to add this
     data to.

   This method will return the backend ID of the backend where data
   was added, or false if it failed.


  remove(NICKNAME, BNUM)

     NICKNAME - Delete the user identified by NICKNAME in the
     addressbook or, if NICKNAME is an array, all users indentified by
     nthe nicknames in the array.

     BNUM - ID of the backend, as returned by add_backend, to remove
     the user(s) from.

   This method will retrun true if the user(s) was removed, or false
   if removal failed.


  modify(NICKNAME, USERDATA, BNUM)

     NICKNAME - Update the user identified by NICKNAME in the
     addressbook.

     USERDATA - Array with user data. The exisiting data for the user
     will be replaced with this.

     BNUM - ID of the backend, as returned by add_backend, to update
     the user in.

   This method will retrun true if the user was modified, or false if
   something failed.


If one of the above methods fail, an error message is available in the
AddressBook->error variable. Feel free to ignore it.


For the result of a search, lookup or list_addr, one or more result
arrays are used. These arrays contain the following keys:

  nickname:  Unique identifier for this name in this backend. Only
             usable for the local_file backend, and possibly LDAP.
  name:      Person's full name.
  email:     Person's e-mail address.
  backend:   Backend ID where this was found
  source:    Name of the backend where this was found

In addition, the following keys may exist for some backends:

  label:     Additional information about the person

<sect1>Creating compose links easily
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
makeComposeLink() PHP function helps to create links to the compose page
easily, taking into account the user's settings, "Compose in new window" and
"Use JavaScript". Here's how to use it:

1) Build the last part of the URL as follows:
   $comp_uri = 'src/compose.php?mailbox='.$mailboxbox.'&amp;send_to='.urlencode($usermail);

2) The display part of the link can be anything you like (such the name of the user):
   $disp = 'The user's name';

3) Print it:
   echo makeComposeLink($comp_uri, $disp);

makeComposeLink() has been available since SquirrelMail 1.4.2.



Using the comp_in_new JavaScript function
=========================================

comp_in_new is the JavaScript function to popup a new compose window.

the function needs one argument:
1) url with arguments to the compose window.

example 1:
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="comp_in_new("")>

example 2:
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="comp_in_new("../../src/compose.php?argument1=true&amp;argument2=test")>

<sect1>MIME support introduction
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
The intended audience for this document are people who want to understand how
the MIME code works. This is a technical documentation of how mime.php
works and how it parses a MIME encoded message.


Object Structure
----------------
There are two objects that are used: "message" and "msg_header". Here is a
brief overview of what each object contains.

msg_header
   Contains variables for all the necessary parts of the header of a
   message. This includes (but is not limited to) the following:  to, from,
   subject, type (type0), subtype (type1), filename ...

message
   This contains the structure for the message. It contains two parts:
   $header and $entities[]. $header is of type msg_header, and $entities[]
   is an array of type $message. The $entities[] array is optional. If
   it does not exist, then we are at a leaf node, and have an actual
   attachment (entity) that can be displayed. Here is a tree view of how
   this object functions.

   header
   entities
      |
      +--- header
      |
      +--- header
      |    entities
      |       |
      |       +--- header
      |       |
      |       +--- header
      |
      +--- header


Getting the Structure
---------------------
Previously (version 0.4 and below), SquirrelMail handled all the parsing of
the email message. It would read the entire message in, search for
boundaries, and create an array similar to the $message object described
above. This was very inefficient.

Currently, all the parsing of the body of the message takes place on the
IMAP server itself. According to RFC 2060 section 7.4.2, we can use the
BODYSTRUCTURE function which will return the structure of the body (imagine
that). It goes into detail of how the bodystructure should be formatted,
and we have based our new MIME support on this specification.

A simple text/plain message would have a BODYSTRUCTURE similar to the
following:

   ("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 1152 23)

A more complicated multipart message with an attachment would look like:

   (("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 1152 23)("TEXT"
   "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII" "NAME" "cc.diff")
   "<960723163407.20117h@cac.washington.edu>" "Compiler diff" "BASE64"
   4554 73) "MIXED"))

Our MIME functionality implements different functions that recursively
run through this text and parses out the structure of the message. If you
want to learn more about how the structure of a message is returned with
the BODYSTRUCTURE function, please see RFC 2060 section 7.4.2.

NOTE:  SquirrelMail passes the MIME Torture Test written by Mark
       Crispin (author of the IMAP protocol). This message is crazy! It
       has about 30 parts nested inside each other. A very good test,
       and SquirrelMail passed it. It can be found here:

       ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/mirror/unix/imapd/mime/torture-test.mbox

Getting the Body
----------------
Once all the structure of the message has been read into the $message
object, we then need to display the body of one entity. There are a number
of ways we decide which entity to display at a certain time, and I won't go
into that here.

Each entity has its own ID. Entity IDs look something like "1.2.1", or
"4.1", or just "2". You can find a detailed description of how entities
should be identified by reading RFC 2060 section 6.4.5. To fetch the body
of a particular entity, we use the function "BODY[<section>]". For
instance, if we were wanting to return entity 1.2.1, we would send the
IMAP server the command: "a001 FETCH <msg_id> BODY[1.2.1]".

This returns a string of the entire body. Based upon what is in the header,
we may need to decode it or do other things to it.


Closing Notes
-------------
That is basically how it works. There is a variable in mime.php called
$debug_mime that is defined at the top of that file. If you set it to true,
it will output all kinds of valuable information while it tries to decode
the MIME message.

The code in mime.php is pretty well documented, so you might want to poke
around there as well to find out more details of how this works.

If you have questions about this, please direct them to our mailing list:
squirrelmail-users@lists.sourceforge.net

<sect1>So what is this tree stuff?
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
In order to get correct folder deletion across the board for all
different RFC2060 compliant IMAP servers, deleting of folders
needed to work by deleting subfolders (inferiors) first, working
up to the top folder that is desired to be deleted.

The best way to do this was to use a tree, and walk the thing in
preorder to get subfolders first (leaves), working our way up the
tree. I chose to use an array for the tree structure.

The array has the following elements:
$tree[0]["value"]             = <full folder name>
$tree[0]["doIHaveChildren"]   = boolean
$tree[0]["subNodes"]          = indexes of the array that are
                                  child nodes of this node

The trickiest part was finding the correct parent node when creating
a new node in the tree. Check the documentation in the code for
more info on this.

Basically all we had to do was loop through each of the items that
need to be in the tree (folders, subfolders), find their parent,
let their parent know it has a new child, and insert the values
into the child.

Once the tree is generated, a simple preorder or postorder walk
of the tree can be done doing whatever function you desire (delete,
create, etc).

Preorder walking gives you the tree from the leaves up. Postorder
walks the tree from the root node down to the leaves.
