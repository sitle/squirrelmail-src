This is the first stable package of SquirrelMail Extra Decoding Library.

SquirrelMail decoding functions are used to display and convert messages 
encoded in different character sets. Extra decoding library provides support 
of some complex Eastern character sets and some rarely used Apple character 
sets. Current release supports Big5, Windows-874 (cp874, Thai), Windows-949 
(UHC, Korean), EUC-CN, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-TW, GB18030, GB2312, ISO-2022-CN, 
ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-JP-2, ISO-2022-KR, Shift_JIS and various x-mac-* 
character sets.

Extra decoding library can be used in SquirrelMail 1.4.4 or newer. It depends 
on sq_is8bit() function. In order to optimize decoding of Eastern character 
sets, PHP installation needs recode (http://www.php.net/recode) or iconv 
(http://www.php.net/iconv) support. Some decoding functions can use mbstring 
functions present in php 4.3.0. Mbstring decoding needs sq_mb_list_encodings() 
function from SquirrelMail 1.5.1 or 1.4.6.

Some decoding code that be activated only when $aggressive_decoding variable 
is set to true. This variable should be enabled only on smaller systems, that 
don't call aggressive decoding functions very often. Turning on 
$aggressive_decoding  variable by default in packaged SquirrelMail versions is 
not recommended.

If you find bugs in this library, report them in SquirrelMail bug tracker 
(http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs). Developers will need information about PHP
version, PHP recode, iconv and mbstring extensions, used SquirrelMail version, 
any modification made in functions/i18n.php and mbstring extension settings.
