This module contains extra decoding functions.

Functions are enabled by copying files to SquirrelMail's 
functions/decode/ directory. Requires SM 1.5.1 or SM 1.4.4.

Some functions might need $aggressive_decoding option set to true,
if php install does not have faster recode functions or html-entities
support in mbstring.

eastasia/ functions need sq_mb_list_encodings function that is 
available in SquirrelMail 1.5.1.
