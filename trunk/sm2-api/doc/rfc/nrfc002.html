Hello all,

Before I start sharing my thoughts about the message stuff in zookeeper,
I may as well introduce myself, since I hope to contribute to zookeeper,
which means working together with you all, doesn't it?

I am Wouter Teepe, 24 year old male, currently professor at Artificial
Intelligence at the Univeristy of Groningen, The Netherlands (GMT+2).
Somewhere in the coming months I'll start my PhD project, which has
something to do with normative role-based access to sensitive database
in a heavily interconnected database environment.

In my student years, I attended various programming contests at all
levels. My personal interests include politics, sailing and photography.
Last but certainly not least, I live happily together with my girlfriend
Lotte.

I look forward to help making Zookeeper and Squirrelmail 2 not only
possible, but *really good*.

Having said this, let's start:


I've been thinking on the message stuff, with the following
considerations in mind:

* some of the protocols support mime (IMAP4rev1, others?), which is
pretty cool, because then you only have to fetch the parts you want
(this is also what squirrelmail currently does)

* some other protocols tolerate mime, which means the client has to
detect all boundaries, parts and stuff

* we want to reduce traffic to IMAP/POP/NNTP servers to a minimum (like
only fetching mime parts which are being displayed and so on)

* we may want to support numerous content-transfer-encodings, maybe
including en-/decrypion

(For the time of this message, I concentrate mainly on reading messages,
not (yet) on composing them. (But I think composing is simple compared
to reading, because ... well, I just think so))



This makes we need several components (layers?):


1) the message-fetching layer

it contains:
* IMAP/POP/NNTP/whatever protocol (from now: fetch protocol)
it needs in order to operate:
- activation control:
  * server, port
- user information:
  * username, password (optional)
- message input:
  * foldername (optional)
  * something to identify a message
it serves:
* some sort of a message object, which contains
  * the header
  * its mime structure, if supported by the fetch protocol (IMAP4rev1,
others?)
* methods to retrieve the body (parts)

When a message is non-mime, mimic a single-part text/plain or something
else sensible.

I will call this layer 1-bacic if it does not have the mime structure,
and 1-cool if it does.

For fetch protocols not supporting mime, we need a mime-layer on top of
1):


2) mime-recognition layer

it contains:
* MIME decoding
it needs in order to operate:
- activation control:
  * whether the fetch protocol supports mime
- message input:
  * mime-fields of a message header
  * the message body
it serves:
* some sort of a message object, which contains
  * the header
  * its mime structure
* methods to retrieve the body (parts)

When a message is non-mime, mimic a single-part text/plain or something
else sensible.

With 1) and optionally 2) stacked on it, we have an interface serving
mime objects.
So all protocols we may want to support converting whole mime structures
into others, should go here. The only type of action I can think of for
now are verification and decription, but maybe others exist. (oh yeah, I
have one, see down later this message)


3) mime converting layer

it contains:
* decoding of certain types of mime structures,
  like multipart/signed, application/x-pkcs-7-mime and others
  with gnupg (pgp) or openssl (s/mime) or other helper software
it needs in order to operate:
- activation control:
  * some criterium on a message header (mime-type, protocol, others?)
- user information:
  * private key(s) of the user (optional)
  * public keyring of the user (pgp, optional)
  * ca database (s/mime, optional)
- message input:
  * body parts of the message
it serves:
* some sort of a message object, which contains
  * the header
  * its mime structure
* methods to retrieve the body (parts)
* additional information on the status of the body parts (e.g. "signed
by F. Bar")
special note:
* this layer could may be applied more than once to a single message
  (once for encrypted, once for signed, once for ...)

With these layers present, I think we should have access to any part of
any sensible message. However, interpreting the parts on their own still
needs to be done:


4) decoding layer

it contains
* decoding of various content-transfer-encodings (BASE64, uuencoded, all
the others)
it needs in order to operate:
- activation control:
  * the content-transfer-encoding of a body part
- message input:
  * a body part
it serves:
* a decoded body part

Of course, this layer could be instantiated as transparent decoding,
decoding actually nothing.

The output of layer 4) is (finally) ready for displaying software:


5) display layer:

it contains
* external spawning or displaying of body parts
it needs in order to operate:
- activation control:
  * some criterium on a body part (mime-type, filename, mime-magic
bytes, others?)
- message input:
  * a decoded body part
it serves (yes, we arrived!):
* a user interpretable version of the body part (visual, auditive,
whatever...)


I think this can serve as a basis for the message architecture.

However, strictly spoken, layers 2-5 could be seen as mime architecture
handling. If not an argument for splitting the messageWAS into a
messagewas and a mimeWAS, it should be an argument for expelling
everithing possible from these layers that reminds of it being a message
that it processes.

Having said that, I think there are actually 4 WAS'es here:

==layer #==   ==type==                  ==typical WASP
  1             message-fetching          IMAP, POP, NNTP
  3             mime converting           pgp, s/mime
  4             decoding                  base64, uudecode, transparent
  5             viewing                   "html-safemaker", download,
                                          (whatever one wishes to
send/view)

We might even introduce some cacheing layer somewhere between the layers
1 to 5, but I think it belongs best within layer 3, doing no converting
at all, but just keeping a copy. For simplicity, I'll forget cacheing
for now.

Not all layers are applied to all messages. Layers 1 and 5 suffice for
simple messages and a nice server. The interfaces should however be such
that all layers can be tied together in almost any combination the
message urges us to.

So:
* 1-basic+2, 1-cool and 3 should connect to both 3 and 4.
* 4 should connect to 5

When not having a transparent layer 4, we it reads like this:
* 1-basic+2, 1-cool and 3 should connect to 3, 4 and 5.
* 4 should connect to 5


These are my thoughts for now. Please, shout!

Of course, not all instantiations of layer 3 do serve mime, just like
not all fetch protocols do. This means that two versions of layer 3
exist: 3-basic and 3-cool. 3-basic needs to tie to layer 2 (uh, forget
that 2 is lower than 3) to make sure that its mime structure gets
parsed.

I've just been thinking layers 3 and 4 could/should be merged: some
awkward client may want to send a base64-encoded multipart mime
message, and of course we would like to be able to parse and interpret
it.

I think it would also simplify the architecture. Maybe there is some
priority problem poking up if we merge them, because for example pgp
and s/mime messages should not be modified before they are verified.
