<!--

Zookeeper is a set PHP libraries designed to be used in the 
constructions of web applications. These libraries provide 
flexible, abstract, and reusable components which form both 
high and low-level building blocks of web applications.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 History</A>
</H2>

<P>Zookeeper is (sort of) a spinoff of the 
<A HREF="http://www.squirrelmail.org/">Squirrelmail</A> 
project.  Squirrelmail was a major part of the ideas behind 
Zookeeper and (if all goes well) will be the first mainstream 
open source software project to make use of Zookeeper.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Goals</A>
</H2>

<P>The goal of this project is to provide an open source framework 
useful in building web applications with PHP. Zookeeper does 
this by through a variety of php libraries that can be utilized 
as the building blocks of any web application.
<P>To put it simply, the purpose of Zookeeper is to make it easy 
for web applications to be written in PHP. It hopes to accomplish 
this in a couple different ways:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>By providing libraries of PHP code that make up the stuff 
that is regularly rewritten for each new web application that 
surfaces in the open source software world.</LI>
<LI>By encouraging programming techniques that will help web 
application projects generally be more successful.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Status</A>
</H2>

<P>At this point, Zookeeper is still mostly an idea. Although 
development on Zookeeper is beginning with the help of some of 
the folks from the Squirrelmail project, Zookeeper is still 
pre-alpha in nature.
