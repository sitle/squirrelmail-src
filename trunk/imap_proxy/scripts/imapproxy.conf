## imapproxy.conf
##
## This is the global configuration file for SquirrelMail IMAP Proxy.
## Lines beginning with a '#' sign are treated as comments and will be
## ignored.  Each line to be processed must be a space delimited
## keyword/value pair.  
##

#
## server_hostname
##
## This setting controls which IMAP server we proxy our connections to.
#
server_hostname your.imap.server.com


#
## connect_retries
##
## This setting controls how many times we retry connecting to our server.
## The delay between retries is configurable with 'connect_delay'
#
connect_retries 10
connect_delay 5

#
## cache_size
##
## This setting determines how many in-core IMAP connection structures
## will be allocated.  As such, it determines not only how many cached
## connections will be allowed, but really the total number of simultaneous
## connections, cached and active.
#
cache_size 3072


#
## listen_port
##
## This setting specifies which port the proxy server will bind to and
## accept incoming connections from.
#
listen_port 143


#
## listen_address
##
## This setting specifies which address the proxy server will bind to and
## accept incoming connections to.  If undefined, bind to all.
## Must be a dotted decimal IP address.
#
#listen_address 127.0.0.1


#
## server_port
##
## This setting specifies the port that server_hostname is listening on.
## This is the tcp port that we proxy inbound connections to.
##
## If you are using SSL with IMAP Proxy, note that unless the server is
## highly non-standard, this should still be set to the server's normal,
## unencrypted IMAP port and should NOT be set to port 993, since IMAP
## Proxy uses STARTTLS to encrypt a "normal" IMAP connection.
##
## If the server is only available via (encrypted) port 993, please
## consult the README.ssl file for help.
# 
server_port 143

#
## cache_expiration_time
##
## This setting controls how many seconds an inactive connection will be
## cached.
#
cache_expiration_time 300


#
## proc_username
##
## This setting controls which username the IMAP proxy process will run as.
## It is not allowed to run as "root".
#
proc_username nobody

#
## proc_groupname
##
## This setting controls which groupname the IMAP proxy process will run as.
#
proc_groupname nobody


#
## stat_filename
##
## This is the path to the filename that the proxy server mmap()s to
## write statistical data to.  This is the file that pimpstat needs to
## look at to be able to provide his useful stats.
#
stat_filename /var/run/pimpstats


#
## protocol_log_filename
##
## protocol logging may only be turned on for one user at a time.  All
## protocol logging data is written to the file specified by this path.
#
protocol_log_filename /var/log/imapproxy_protocol.log


#
## syslog_facility
##
## The logging facility to be used for all syslog calls.  If nothing is
## specified here, it will default to LOG_MAIL.  Any of the possible
## facilities listed in the syslog(3C) manpage may be used here except
## LOG_KERN.
#
syslog_facility LOG_MAIL


#
## syslog_prioritymask
##
## This configuration option is provided as a way to limit the verbosity
## of squirrelmail-imap_proxy.  If no value is specified, it will default
## to no priority mask and you'll see all possible log messages.  Any of
## the possible priority values listed in the syslog(3C) manpage may be
## used here.  By default, I've left this commented out so you will see
## all possible log messages.
#
#syslog_prioritymask LOG_WARNING


#
## send_tcp_keepalives
##
## This determines whether the SO_KEEPALIVE option will be set on all
## sockets.
#
send_tcp_keepalives no


#
## enable_select_cache
##
## This configuration option allows you to turn select caching on or off.
## When select caching is enabled, squirrelmail-imap_proxy will cache SELECT
## responses from an IMAP server.
#
enable_select_cache no


#
## foreground_mode
##
## This will prevent squirrelmail-imap_proxy from detaching from his parent
## process and controlling terminal on startup.
#
foreground_mode no


#
## force_tls
##
## Force squirrelmail-imap_proxy to use STARTTLS even if LOGIN is not disabled.
#
force_tls no


#
## chroot_directory
##
## This allows squirrelmail-imap_proxy to run in a chroot jail if desired.
## If commented out, squirrelmail-imap_proxy will not run chroot()ed.  If
## a directory is specified here, squirrelmail-imap_proxy will chroot() to
## that directory.
#
#chroot_directory /var/empty


#
## preauth_command
##
## Arbitrary command that can be sent to the server before
## authenticating users.  This can be useful to access non-
## standard IMAP servers such as Yahoo!, which requires the
## following command to be sent before authentication is allowed:
##    ID ("GUID" "1")
## (See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Mail#Free_IMAP_and_SMTPs_access )
## To use such a command, this setting should look like this:
##    preauth_command ID ("GUID" "1")
## No matter what this command is, it is expected to return an
## OK response
#
#preauth_command


#
## enable_admin_commands
##
## Used to enable or disable the internal squirrelmail-imap_proxy
## administrative commands.
#
enable_admin_commands no


#
## Various path options for SSL CA certificates/directories
#
#tls_ca_file /usr/share/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
#tls_ca_path /usr/share/ssl/certs/
#tls_cert_file /usr/share/ssl/certs/mycert.crt
#tls_key_file /usr/share/ssl/certs/mycert.key


#
## Authenticate using SASL AUTHENTICATE PLAIN
##
## The following authentication username and password are used
## along with the username from the client as the authorization
## identity.  In order to avoid having the service wide open (no
## password needed from the client), the client is required to
## send the auth_shared_secret in leiu of a user password.
##
## NOTE: This functionality *assumes* that the server supports
##       AUTHENTICATE PLAIN, and it does *not* verify this by
##       looking at the server's capabilities list.
#
#auth_sasl_plain_username
#auth_sasl_plain_password
#auth_shared_secret
