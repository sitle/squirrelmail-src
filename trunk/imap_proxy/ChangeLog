2010-08-19  Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>
	* Added several warnings that try to catch the case where someone
          tries to set the server_port to 993, which is usually a mistaken
          use of TLS/SSL (port 993 is usually for imaps, which is not
          supported; IMAP Proxy supports STARTTLS from a "normal" port,
          which is usually 143)
