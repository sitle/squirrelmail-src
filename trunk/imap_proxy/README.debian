Michael Faurot <mfaurot at atww.org> submitted some helpful information
for people building and installing squirrelmail-imapproxy on Debian Linux
systems.  I've included his information here, exactly as he submitted it.

It's now worth noting that there's an official Debian package for
squirrelmail-imapproxy (courtesy of Jose Luis Tallon) so you might
want to save yourself some time and effort and just apt-get that.


o)	On a Debian system that uses UW IMAP you'll need to rename
	/etc/rc2.d/S99rmnologin to something like S98rmnologin.  Then be
	sure the rc script for imapproxy is run as S99imapproxy.
	This insures that when imapproxy goes to query the imap
	daemon, the IMAP daemon will actually say it's ready.  UW IMAP
	respects the /etc/nologin file, and if imapproxy queries while
	/etc/nologin is still present, imapproxy will fail to start.
	Debian creates /etc/nologin during the early stages of bootup,
	to prevent premature logins, and then removes it in the last
	stages of going multiuser.


o)	Add a PATH statement close to the top of the rc script
	and then adjust the call to basename not to use a full
	pathname.  The original script called /bin/basename.  On a
	Debian system basename is in /usr/bin.  For example:

	PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:"
	export PATH


o)	If building against locally created OpenSSL libraries that
	have been installed into the default locations under
	/usr/local these variables will need to be exported before
	running "configure":

		CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/ssl/include"
		LIBS="-L/usr/local/ssl/lib"
		export CFLAGS LIBS


o)	I built my installation of imapproxy  against my own locally 
	compiled copies of OpenSSL's static libraries on a Debian stable
	system.  It appears, from some messages that were on the
	mailing list, that people attempting to build imapproxy using
	the stock Debian OpenSSL libraries may not realize they also
	need to install the development package for OpenSSL to get its
	headers and libraries.  That can be done like this:

		apt-get install libssl-dev
