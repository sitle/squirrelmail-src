<br>
<tt>object status ([$folder])</tt><br>
<br>
Returns information about the current folder in an object.
The following are properties of that object:<br>
<ul>
   <li>name - name of the folder</li>
   <li>num_msgs - number of messages</li>
   <li>num_recent - number of recent messages</li>
   <li>num_unread - number of unread messages</li>
</ul>
<br>
In case of errors, set the $error variable and return false.  
<br><br>

If no $folder is specified, then assume $this->folder.  However,
with this, it is a requirement that <tt>$this->select($folder)</tt>
has been called previous to this.  If this hasn't happened,
in this case consider it an error and return a new instance of
the Error class (also set the <tt>$this-&gt;error</tt> variable).
