NAME
	Framework for Object Orientated Development - FOOWD

VERSION
	0.8.3

DESCRIPTION
	FOOWD is a framework for building object orientated (OO) web applications
	in PHP. It is a collection of base classes ripe for extending that handle
	object persistency, user authorisation, security, data administration,
	input handling, all the things required to build OO web applications.

DOCUMENTATION
	The beginnings of a FOOWD manual can be found at http://foowd.peej.co.uk/

REQUIREMENTS
	* PHP 4.2.0+ (tested with 4.3.1)
	* MySQL 3+ (tested with 3.23.28)
	* A web server with access to the above tools.

QUICK & DIRTY INSTALLATION
	* Extract the archive somewhere into the web root of your web server keeping
	the directory structure in tact, the archive will create a directory called
	"foowd".
	* Fire up a web browser and navigate to your new site.
	* Enjoy.
	
	This installation leaves every user having full permission over your Foowd
	system, to secure it follow steps 6 onwards below.
	
FULL INSTALLATION
	1. Extract the archive somewhere into the web root of your web server keeping
	the directory structure in tact, the archive will create a directory called
	"foowd".
	2. Make a copy of config.default.php and open it in your favourite PHP editor.
	Set the database server hostname, etc. Foowd will try to create the database
	and table if they do not already exist. Save the file.
	3. Open the lead-in document, index.php. Change the second line to point to
	your new config.
	4. Fire up a web browser and navigate to your new site.
	5. If you want all the default pages from the Foowd web site in your
	copy or Foowd gave you a database error, connect to your MySQL server using
	your favourite client with a user with the appropriate privileges and create
	yourself a new database. Use the database creation script mysql.sql to create
	the FOOWD table tlbObject and populate it with the initial data. Then go back
	to your web browser and refresh the page.
	6. Use the link to the left labelled User::Create to create yourself a user.
	7. View that user and use the link labelled Admin to administrate the user.
	8. In the Groups array at the foot of the form, add the index "0" to the left
	hand textbox and the user group name "Gods" to the right hand box. Hit submit.
	9. Now open your configuration file and set the constant "ANON_GOD" to "FALSE"
	to disable giving full permissions to the anonymous user.
	10. Go back to the site and user the link labelled User::Login to log in as
	your new user.
	11. Enjoy.

FLATFILE INSTALLATION
	* Extract the archive somewhere into the web root of your web server keeping
	the directory structure in tact, the archive will create a directory called
	"foowd".
	* Edit your config file and change the constant "DATABASE" to "flatfile".
	* Fire up a web browser and navigate to your new site.
	* Enjoy.
	
	The flat file layer is buggy and slow and is not recommended for anything over
	trying out Foowd when a DB is not available. In no circumstances should it be
	used for a live system
	
UPGRADING
	If you already have an older FOOWD install you can upgrade by copying the
	contents of foowd/lib/ from the archive into your existsing foowd/lib/ directory.
