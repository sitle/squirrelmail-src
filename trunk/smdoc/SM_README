This repository is designed to pull in the 3rd party source for
WikiTypeFramework/FOOWD, while allowing for our updates and customizations.

Original Import:
cvs import -m "Import of wtfw-0.20.2" smdoc WTFW WTFW_0_20_2
cvs import -m "Import of foowd-0.8" smdoc WTFW FOOWD_0_8

The procedures below will not work with the conversion between WTFW and FOOWD.
Some cleaning of the CVS repository will occur with migration.

Updates for later WTFW/FOOWD versions (x.x.x):
http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_13.html#SEC107

$ cd foowd-x.x.x
$ cvs import -m "Import of foowd-x.x.x" smdoc WTFW FOOWD_x_x_x
