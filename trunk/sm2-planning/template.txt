Document Template
Author: Paul Joseph Thompson <thomppj@squirrelmail.org>
=======================================================

Purpose:  Here is a brief description of the purpose of this document.
It should be just a few sentences at most. This is our document template.


New Section
===========
This is a new section. It will contain brilliant ideas. For now, however,
it does not really contain anything useful. Oh yeah, each new section
should start like this one and the others below.

                    | | | | | |
                    +-+-+-+-+-+
                    |         |
                   -|   o o   |-
                   \|    \    |/
                    |         |
                    |   ---   |
                     \_______/

A section can have multiple paragraphs and pictures, if you like. Please
note that is the first piece of ascii art that I have ever created.

Also note that each section should have two blank lines before it.  This
makes it easier to glance through the document and pull out the headers as
they stand out much better.


Word Wrapping
=============
Keep in mind that all documents should be word wrapped at 80 characters.


VI Tips:
========
To set text wrapping to 80 characters, use the command ":set tw=80". To
reformat the text wrapping for the current paragraph, move the cursor
to that paragraph and type "gqap".
