Description of the SquirrelMail 2 Engine
Author: Paul Joseph Thompson <thomppj@squirrelmail.org>
=======================================================

Purpose: To give a more detailed description of the SquirrelMail 2 
Engine. This is a part of my description of the SquirrelMail 2 Core 
Architecture (::sm2-core.txt::).


Steps Carried Out by the SquirrelMail 2 Engine
==============================================
The following are the general steps that the SM2 Engine (index.php) would 
carry out in response to a request from a browser.

1. Retrieve Global Configuration Information
2. Check Authentication.
     a. If good, set auth-failed to false
     b. Otherwise, set auth-failed to true
3. Retrieve User Configuration Information
4. Request Handler Loop
     a. Run Request Handler
     b. Exit loop if Request Handler is done
     c. Otherwise, retrieve data as specified by
        request handler
     d. Loop (start again at 4a)
5. Run Request Handler result through UI Builder
6. Return Result from UI Builder to the web browser


Error Handling
==============
Any time that an error occurs, an Error object is created. If this
happens before the Request Handler finishes, it will handle this error
as it sees fit. Otherwise, uhh... Well, we'll have to do something else.
