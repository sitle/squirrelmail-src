The Future of SquirrelMail (etc)
Authors: Paul Joseph Thompson <thomppj@squirrelmail.org>
         Luke Ehresman <luke@squirrelmail.org>
==============================================

Purpose: To document plans for development of SquirrelCore, SquirrelMail, 
SquirrelContacts, and the othe Squirrel Applications.


Squirrel Application Roadmap and Versioning
===========================================
To keep with the original goals of the SquirrelMail project, initial 
development of SquirrelMail Application suite will consist of the coding 
required to build first the foundation for the Squirrel Applications, and 
then to create SquirrelMail 2 itself. This will be completed before any 
work is started on SquirrelCalender, SquirrelNotes, and SquirrelTasks.

Currently the development roadmap and versioning will be as follows. 
Note that "+--" is used to denote steps that will happen concurrently. 
All other steps will happen in the sequence given.

  I. Primary Development of Squirrel Applications
         A. Building the Foundation
              1. Development of SquirrelCore 0.1 (up to 0.5)
              2. Development of SquirrelContacts 0.1 (up to 0.3)
         B. Core Development of SquirrelMail 2
              +-- Development of SquirrelCore 0.5 (up to 0.9)
              +-- Development of SquirrelContacts 0.3 (up to 0.9)
              +-- Development of SquirrelMail 1.9

  II. Primary Release of Squirrel Applications
         +-- Release of SquirrelCore 1.0
         +-- Release of SquirrelContacts 1.0
         +-- Release of SquirrelMail 2.0
           
  III. Secondary Development of Squirrel Applications
         +-- Development of SquirrelMail 2.1
         +-- Development of SquirrelCalender 0.1 (up to 0.9)
         +-- Development of SquirrelNotes 0.1 (up to 0.9)
         +-- Development of SquirrelTasks 0.1 (up to 0.9)
         
  IV. Secondary Release of Squirrel Applications
         +-- Release of SquirrelMail 2.2 (if necessary)
         +-- Release of SquirrelCalender 1.0
         +-- Release of SquirrelNotes 1.0
         +-- Release of SquirrelTasks 1.0

It is required that SquirrelContacts development begin as a part of the 
initial development of SquirrelCore because of the role played by the 
SquirrelContacts API. Also, the full SquirrelContacts application will be 
developed concurrently with SquirrelMail 2 since an addressbook is a core 
feature of most standard email clients, including SquirrelMail 1.


Controllers and Application Independant Templates
=================================================
Luke: This is an idea I had last night. I will explain it to you next 
time we get together for a chat. If you like it, we can use it.


Controllers Types
=================
Must be one controller of each type for each Squirrel Application.


Integrated, Context-Sensitive, In-Depth Help System
===================================================
SquirrelApps needs one. Talk more about this later.


Internationalization of Squirrel Applications
=============================================
Current ideas for addressing this internationalization of Squirrel 
Applications are as follows:

  1. a system similar to our current plan.
  2. a new system as drempt up by Paul
  
This "new system drempt up by Paul" involves the use of variables (maybe 
in an array) for each translatable phrase, word, sentance. First, a 
default translation file would be loaded. Then the language file would be 
loaded.


Integration of 'Public User Access'
===================================
How will this be done?
