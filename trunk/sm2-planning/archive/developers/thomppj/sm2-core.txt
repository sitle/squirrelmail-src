SquirrelMail 2 Core Architecture
Author: Paul Joseph Thompson <thomppj@squirrelmail.org>
=======================================================

Purpose: This document details my proposal for the core architecture of 
SquirrelMail 2. It describes what I have named the SM2 Engine, Request 
Handlers, and UI Builder, as well as the function and interoperation of 
the APIs.


SquirrelMail 2 Engine
=====================
The SquirrelMail 2 Engine will serve as the php script (index.php) 
which will receives all SquirrelMail requests. The engine is the part of 
SquirrelMail that serves as the framework for the rest of SquirrelMail. 
Upon this framework, the API which make up the rest of SquirrelMail will 
rest. This code is responsible for putting together all of the pieces and 
is, therefore, the most important part of SquirrelMail. More details can 
be found in the file ::sm2-engine.txt::.


SquirrelMail 2 API
==================

SM2 will contain a variety of APIs which will each provide a different 
branch of squirrelmail operational needs. At this point, the following 
API will be a part of SquirrelMail 2:

  + SquirrelMail Message API
    SqMessage (::api/SqMessage.txt::)
    
  + SquirrelMail Preferences API
    SqPreferences (::api/SqPreferences.txt::)
    
  + SquirrelMail Addressbook API
    SqAddressBook (::api/SqAddressBook.txt::)
    
  + SquirrelMail User Account API
    SqUserAccount (::api/SqUserAccount.txt::)
  
  + SquirrelMail Logging API
    SqLogger (::api/SqLogger.txt::)
    
  + SquirrelMail Request Handler API
    SqReqHandler (::api/SqRequestHandler.txt::)
    
  + SquirrelMail User Interface Builder API
    SqUIBuilder (::api/SqUIBuilder.txt::)
    
For details about the implementation of these API, please see the 
document ::sm2-api.txt:: or the documents in my ::api/:: directory.
