The Project Formally Know as SquirrelApps
Author: Paul Joseph Thompson <thomppj@squirrelmail.org>
=======================================================

Purpose: To give some details about the naming of this project.


Naming Details
==============
We like animals. O'Reilly knows well enough that they are cool, and so do 
we. Therefore, we have decided to continue in the fabulous tradition of 
SquirrelMail and name all of the Squirrel Applications after animals. To 
start with, the project formally know as "SquirrelApps" will now be 
called Project Zookeeper. The applications currently planned for 
inclusion in zookeeper are as follows.

  * SquirrelMail: the webmail client we all know and love
  * NewsFerret: sort of like SquirrelMail, but for news
  * PenguinNotes: this one is a journal, or memo pad
  * Calender: not yet named
  * Tasks/Todos: not yet named
  * Contacts: not yet named
  * ShutterBug: online photo manager program
  * SpiderWeb: personal website program

Do you have great ideas on what to name one of the "not yet named" 
applications? Please send submissions to thomppj@squirrelmail.org and 
luke@squirrelmail.org.
