Zookeeper Releases
Authors: Paul Joseph Thompson <thomppj@squirrelmail.org>
         Luke Ehresman <luke@squirrelmail.org>
==============================================

Purpose:  This defines our release plans for Zookeeper and related
applications.  This will serve as our roadmap for the future.


Squirrel Application Roadmap and Versioning
===========================================
To keep with the original goals of the SquirrelMail project, initial
development of Zookeeper will consist of the coding required to build first
the foundation for the applications, and then to create SquirrelMail 2 itself.
This will be completed before any work is started on NewsFerret, _Calender,
_Notes, etc.

Below is a detailed roadmap of what will be included in what versions and how
the progression will happen as we near and pass 1.0 of Zookeeper.


Zookeeper [0.1.0]
    This release will be to get much of the basic functionality and framework
    in place.  Everything doesn't have to be functional at this point.  It is
    ok to have stubs in place. 

    * define and start to develop core libs
        + message
        + preference
        + logging
        + uibuilder
        + general functions (strings.inc, date.inc...)
    * SquirrelMail [1.9.0]
    * _Contacts [0.9.0]
    * _Options [0.9.0]
    * _Login [0.9.0]

Zookeeper [0.3.0]
    This should contain a functinoal set of libraries (and modules) that can
    be used to make functional applications.  Some of the basic applications
    should start to become usable.

    * develop working libraries and modules
        + message (imap_general, imap_php)
        + preference (filesystem, mysql)
        + logging (filesystem, syslog, php, email)
        + uibuilder (fast_template, xml_xsl)
        + general functions
    * SquirrelMail [1.9.1]
    * _Contacts [0.9.1]
    * _Options [0.9.1]
    * _Login [0.9.1]

Zookeeper [0.5.0]
    Everything should be mostly fully functional (not necessarily bug free).
    Libraries should be pretty stable, and starting to become mature.  The
    apps should have all functionality, and at bare minimum be usable.  Not
    all features need to be implemented.

    -- FIRST RELEASE ON FRESHMEAT --

    * make libraries and supported modules mature
    * SquirrelMail [1.9.2]
    * _Contacts [0.9.2]
    * _Options [0.9.2]
    * _Login [0.9.2]

Zookeeper [0.6.0]
    With user feedback from 0.5.0, develop this as our first stable release.
    Everything should be functional.  This is ONLY a stablization release.  No
    features or added functionality should be put in.

    * stablize modules and libraries 
    * stablize SquirrelMail [1.9.3]
    * stablize _Contacts [0.9.3]
    * stablize _Options [0.9.3]
    * stablize _Login [0.9.3]

[-- At this point, make a decision if we should start working on 0.9.0 and
[-- then 1.0.0 stable, or if we need another cycle.  If the latter is decided
[-- upon, then 0.7.0 is the next step.  Otherwise 0.9.0.  Either way, they
[-- both are exactly like 0.5.0 and 0.6.0 in development cycle, and should be
[-- released close together.

Zookeeper [1.0.0]
    The official stable release of Zookeeper and SquirrelMail.  It will be
    advertised as "SquirrelMail 2.0 using Zookeeper 1.0".  This release
    contains rock solid applications and modules. 

    Included in this release:
    * modules
        + message (imap_general, imap_php)
        + preference (filesystem, mysql)
        + logging (filesystem, syslog, php, email)
        + uibuilder (fast_template, xml_xsl)
        + general functions
    * SquirrelMail [2.0.0]
    * _Contacts [1.0.0]
    * _Options [1.0.0]
    * _Login [1.0.0]

Zookeeper [1.1.x]
    This release will improve upon existing applications, libraries, and
    modules, and will also include several new applications.  Release as many
    1.1.x releases as necessary until everything is stable again.  Don't be
    afraid to release reasonably unstable code.

Zookeeper [1.2.x]
    The stable releases of the applications and modules we worked on in 1.1.x
    series.
