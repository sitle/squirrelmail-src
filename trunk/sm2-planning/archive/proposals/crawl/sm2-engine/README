README for Crawl Proposal: sm2-engine
Author: Paul Joseph Thompson <thomppj@squirrelmail.org>
=======================================================

Purpose: To explain a little about this proposal.


About this Proposal
===================
I have been working on an idea for the core architecture of SquirrelMail 
2 which I have come to call the SquirrelMail 2 Engine. Briefly, the 
concept is based on one central script (index.php) which responds to 
requests made to SquirrelMail by:

  * Pulling together a bunch of SquirrelMail Modules (implementations of 
    our various API)
  * Running them through a Request Handler (which processes the request)
  * Running the Request Handler's repsonse through a UI Builder (which 
    creates the output to be sent back to the browser)

This proposal is documented in my planning directory. The main document 
can be found at ::/developers/thomppj/sm2-core.txt::.

The crawl implementation of this proposal is a fancy hello world program.
