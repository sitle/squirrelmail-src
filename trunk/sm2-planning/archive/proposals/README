Architecture Proposals README
Authors: Luke Ehresman <luke@squirrelmail.org>

========================================================

Purpose: To explain the process for making proposals concerning the 
development and architecture of SquirrelMail 2.


What is this all about?
=======================
This all came about during one of our developer meetings. Many proposals 
were made, more than we could handle at one time. Additionally, we wanted 
to see what some of these proposals were made of (some working demos). 
Therefore, we decided to create this proposals directory as a part of the 
sm2-planning module. It is a place for proposals to take shape, flourish 
a little, and maybe even become something real.


What are the directories for?
=============================
There are three stages of a proposal: crawl, walk, sprint.

The crawl stage involves a very basic implementation of the proposal. It 
should be extremely simple and, if possible, be implemented as some form 
of the classic "Hello World" program. (::crawl/::).

If all goes well with the crawl stage of the proposal, it will continue 
onward with the walk stage. This implementation of the proposal should 
take a little more time to develop and generally be a more filled in. It 
should be a clear working model that does a good job demonstrating and 
explaining your proposal. (::walk/::).

Lastly, proposals that make it past the walk stage will move on to the 
sprint stage. In this stage, development will begin on the proposal as it 
would actually be implemented as a part of SquirrelMail 2. If a proposal 
is accepted for the development of SquirrelMail 2, this code will usually 
form the foundation for the integration of this proposal. (::sprint/::)


Proposal Review
===============
When a proposal in crawl or walk stage is ready for review, a message 
should be sent to the development list requesting that we start looking 
over your idea. This will be done on an individual level, and through 
mailing list and irc discussion.
