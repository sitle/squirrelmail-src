PTemplate Templating Proposal
Author: Tyler Akins <fidian@tiny.net>
=======================================================

Purpose:  To show how the PTemplate engine could be used as the template
engine for SquirrelMail.


Sudden Enlightenment
====================
All in all, I think that most of the proposals are proposing a very similar
thing.  Just slightly different implementations.  :-)  It just took me a
while to see this.  I'm slow.  Be happy that I only included one paragraph
on the topic.


The Reasoning
=============
Whatever template engine that is finally decided upon for SM2 should not be
fed information.  PTemplate (available at http://ptemplate.sourceforge.net)
is a different type of template engine.  It allows the template designer to
create or fetch information as is needed.

I should really rename the project or something, because PTemplate is not a
template engine anymore.  It is just a way to facilitate templates easier.
Actually, there are no templates anymore.  They are all PHP scripts, so that
decreases the time processing dramatically.  Also, since each script isn't
loaded, that saves even more time.

PTemplate also allows information to be streamed to the host, saving a lot
on memory, compared to other template engines.  However, this is kinda a
cheat, since if I don't want streaming, I have to do something special (use
the ob_start() function).


Downfalls
=========
Realistically, this is the MOST important part of the proposal.  Below are
some obvious and not-so-obvious downfalls to using PTemplate.

  * The people designing should know PHP
  * PHP code should be stuck in modules as much as possible (style issue)


Current Status
==============

Added a colorful template to the main screen, made the template selection
stick with the session (should probably save in a user file instead), etc.
