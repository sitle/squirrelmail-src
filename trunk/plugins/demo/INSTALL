Installing Plugin
=================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the demo plugin.

    $ cd /var/www/squirrelmail/plugins
    $ tar -xzvf /home/archives/demo-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

    $ cd ../config/
    $ ./conf.pl
