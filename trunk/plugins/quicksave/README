QuickSave Plugin
-------------------

This automatically saves the email message you're composing against
accidentally being wiped out by refreshing the right frame or otherwise
leaving the Compose page. Think of it as anti-anti-caching :)

It's all very simple javascript on the Compose page, and a form that
we're using for storagin in the left_main page. You won't ever know
that it's installed unless you've lost a message and it can be
recovered.

If there are problems, or JavaScript inconsistancies, please notify
me (Ray Black) at allah@accessnode.net, or else post to the
squirrelmail-plugins list.

It should be noted that this plugin requires at least SquirrelMail
version 1.0pre3.
