auto_cc SquirrelMail Plugin
---------------------------
Version 1.2 by Benjamin Brillat <brillat-sqplugin@mainsheet.org> - 20 Apr 2001

This is a really quick hack (my first plugin) to let you set
a default list of CC or BCC addresses which should always be used.  I needed this
because my Sent mailbox is at another address, so simply saving a copy to the
"Sent" folder isn't good enough.

It should be pretty straightforward after that.  If you have any questions or
(more importantly) can make this any better, please e-mail:
brillat-sqplugin@mainsheet.org

Also, big thanks to Tyler Akins for removing the JavaScript!!
