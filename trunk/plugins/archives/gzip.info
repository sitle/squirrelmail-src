        Compresses outgoing messages. Requires that you add two hooks in pages
        that you want compressed. This plugin is really designed more for a
        demonstration of how output could easily be compressed. I would like
        some new hooks added, and this would be one demonstration for why they
        should be there. Kinda a fun thing, kinda an experiment.
