Message of the Day Plugin
=============================================
Ben Brillat, <brillat-sqplugin@mainsheet.org>
motd v1.2, Apr 20 2001 

This is another plugin in the class of "insanely simple plugins".

It will allow you to place a "Message of the Day" on the login
screen.  This message is read from the config/motd.php file, 
which can contain any PHP code or HTML.  If that file does not
exist, the message is taken from the $motd variable defined 
in the standard SquirrelMail configuration.

=============================================
UPDATES
The newest version of this and other plugins that I have written
should always be available from:
http://ben.brillat.net/files/projects/squirrelmail/
I will also try to get the most recent version listed on the
SquirrelMail plugins page.

=============================================
CHANGELOG

1.2	Fixed a bug with the closing ?>
1.0	Initial Release
