INSTALLING the vchpass plugin for Squirrelmail
-----------------------------------------------
This plugin allows users to change their password. This plugin will ONLY
work if you're using VmailMgr as your user base software. See 
http://www.vmailmgr.org. If you're NOT using vmailmgr, this plugin is
not what you're looking for.

Before you begin, READ the SECURITY file. I am not joking. This plugin
is a gaping security hole if measures are not implemented to secure it.
Even with measures, this is still a potential weakness in your system,
so if you cherish your system integrity above all (==paranoid), then
don't use this plugin. You've been warned.

Now, if you've read SECURITY and decided that you still want to use this
plugin, then read on.

UNTARRING THE PLUGIN
---------------------
Make sure you do that in plugins directory. If you didn't, then just
do a recursive copy of the whole vchpass directory to land it in
plugins/vchpass.

MAKING SURE VMAILMGRD IS RUNNING
---------------------------------
vmailmgrd needs to be running in order for this plugin to work. Check your
VmailMgr installation/documentation for info.

GETTING VMAIL.INC
-------------------
VmailMgr distributions come with a PHP include file which allows to
interface with vmailmgrd -- a daemon that handles all password changes
and other nifty vmailmgr stuff done via the web. Go to the directory
where you untarred your VmailMgr sources and find the file called 
'vmail.inc'. It is most likely located in the PHP3/ directory. Copy 
that file into the plugins/vchpass directory.

SETTING UP vchpass.php
-----------------------
Open vchpass.php in your favorite editor (it's VIM, right?), and edit
the variables up at the top to work for you. Instructions are within the
code.

SECURE YOUR INSTALLATION
-------------------------
If you don't do that, you'll regret it at some point. Read the file
SECURITY for ways to make this plug-in secure.

ENABLE THIS PLUG-IN
--------------------
Edit the config/config.php and add a line:
plugins[x]="vchpass";
Or use a conf.pl script to enable this plugin, which does just that.

Sit back and relax. ;)

QUESTIONS/BUGS
---------------
Since plugins are not supported by squirrelmail, you can e-mail me
directly at graf@relhum.org. However, if you send it to the squirrelmail
list, it will have more chances to be noticed. ;) The list address is
squirrelmail-plugins@lists.sourceforge.net.
