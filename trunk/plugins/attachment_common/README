Attachments (Common) -- Version 1.7

This adds a View button and changes the default link for supported
attachment types.


Features
========

* Keeps the look and feel of SquirrelMail when viewing images
* Views several recognized text types
* Views several image types, if the browser supports them
* Can add a "vcard" Business Card into your address book


Description
===========

When you get a message with an attachment of an image or a text message
in your mail, this plugin will help you to view it properly.  It auto-detects
the images the browser can view, and will only add the "view" link if the
browser supports that type.

If the type is "application/octet-stream", then this plugin attempts to
determine the correct extension for the file types it can view, and will
run the appropriate one.


Future Work
===========

* Other common attachments?
* Detect other extensions and call their hook (whether we catch it or not)


Installation
============

As with other plugins, just uncompress the archive in the plugins
directory, go back to the main directory, run configure and add the plugin.

Changes
=======
1.6 -> 1.7
  * Bugfixes
  * Major code cleanup for application/octet-stream
  * Auto-detects .php
  * More advanced $HTTP_ACCEPT stuff (caused problems before)
  * Debugging information if it's set in functions/plugin.php
  
1.5 -> 1.6
  * Rewrote vCard parsing.  Outlook 2000's cards now work.
  
1.4 -> 1.5
  * Stupid bugfixes.
  * Outlook 2000's vcards now work
  
1.3 -> 1.4
  * 1.0.1 (and later) will not call the plugin with the data passed by
    reference.  We have to code around that inside the plugin (put a &
    before the $Data).  This should still work with pre-1.0.1
    
1.2 -> 1.3
  * Oops.  Fixed another bug with the application/octet-stream stuff.
  * Added text/x-vcard handling.  Lots of code is thanks to Stefan Sels.

1.1 -> 1.2
  * Forgot to finish a function I was writing for application/octet-stream
    type attachments to automatically scan the extension of the file to
    try to determine which attachment handler to use.

1.0 -> 1.1
  * "application/octet-stream" type now searches the extension of the file
    to possibly determine correct hook to run
