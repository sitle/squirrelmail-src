    Simply puts a clock at the top of the folder listing. Perhaps it isn\'t 
    very useful, but hey, we needed some plugins in here! I actually find it 
    very useful especially if the time on your server is different than the 
    time on your local machine (i.e.  time zones). This lets you know what all
