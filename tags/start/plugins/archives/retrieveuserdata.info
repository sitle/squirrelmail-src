        This plugin retrieves the full name and the email address of a
        SquirrelMail user from an external source (currently only LDAP) and
        writes them to the user\'s preferences file. Your users don\'t have to
        enter their name and email address before they write their first email.
        If you want to prevent or reduce misuse of your mail system, you can
        also forbid them to change their name and email address (From: line in
        email headers). You can also retrieve the users\' data on every login to
        be up to date with your external source.<br><br>
	If you don\'t want to use LDAP, you can write an extension to access
	another type of information source.
