Installing Plugins
==================
Simply untar the file in the plugins directory, and make sure it is
in its own directory, and that the name of the directory is the name
of the plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar xvpzf /usr/archives/deleteMoveNP.tar.gz

Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
8 and add the plugin (+).  Save and exit, then that should be all
if the plugin was made correctly.  :)

  $ cd ../config
  $ ./conf.pl
