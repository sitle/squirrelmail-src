HOW TO BUILD
##############################################################################

Before you build imapproxy, you're going to need to obtain the OpenSSL
libraries.  Build and install them, then you're ready to move on.

It should be pretty painless:

./configure
make

If you encounter any problems with this, check out README.known_issues to
see if your problem is addressed in there.  If not, ask on the list or file
a bug report.

"make install" will attempt to install the following files:

/usr/local/sbin/in.imapproxyd
/usr/local/sbin/pimpstat

"make install-conf" will attempt to install the sample configuration file:

/etc/imapproxy.conf

"make install-init" will attempt to install the startup script and symlinks:

/etc/init.d/imapproxy
/etc/rc2.d/S99imapproxy
/etc/rc0.d/K10imapproxy

"make pkg" will attempt to install a sun package into /var/spool/package.

After you successfully build the proxy server, you'll need to edit the
global configuration file to suit your needs.  By default, the proxy
server looks at /etc/imapproxy.conf as his default configuration file.  You
can change this at runtime by supplying the -f argument to
/usr/local/sbin/in.imapproxyd.

/usr/local/sbin/pimpstat is the Polling Imap Mail Proxy Statistical tool.  It's
a curses-based application that you can use to monitor the proxy server.  It's
aware of the same global configuration file as the proxy server, and can also
be told to look at a different configuration file by supplying it as a 
parameter with the -f argument.  Both pimpstat and in.imapproxyd must be using
the same configuration file, since the stat file that they both rely on is
set in the configuration file.


##############################################################################
CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
##############################################################################

server_hostname
---------------
This determines which imap server you want to proxy connections to.

cache_size
----------
A slightly misleading configuration option.  It's really the total number of
in-core connections that the server can handle, so it will include all of the
active connections and all of the cached connections.  For performance, no
memory is dynamically allocated within the proxy server once it starts to 
accept connections.  That means that all of the IMAP connection structures have
to be allocated at server startup.  This configuration setting allows you to
control how many of these structures are allocated.  The higher you make this
number, the more memory the server will allocate.  Also, since the proxy
server is multi-threaded it will need to increase the total number of allowed
file descriptors it can have open.  We run with a default setting of 3072
here.  I don't know how big you can make this number before you'd have
problems with setrlimit().

listen_port
-----------
The port that the server binds to and accepts connections on.  This is the
tcp port that IMAP clients will connect to.

cache_expiration_time
---------------------
This is the number of seconds that we keep a connection open to the IMAP server
after a client logs out.  Once a client logs out, the in-core IMAP connection
structure is marked as "cached" instead of "active" and a timestamp is set on
the structure.  Once "cache_expiration_time" seconds have elapsed, this
connection to the server will be closed and any future logins from the user
that was connected on this socket will require a new connection to the server.

proc_username
-------------
The proxy server will NOT run as root.  This is quite simply for security
reasons.  You can specify which user you want the proxy to run as here.

proc_groupname
--------------
This is the groupname that the proxy server will run as.

stat_filename
-------------
The proxy server opens a file and mmap()s a statistical structure when it
starts.  It keeps some really simple numbers in here.  You can use the
pimpstat application to display these numbers and monitor the usage of the
proxy server.

protocol_log_filename
---------------------
The proxy server allows you to turn on protocol logging on a per-user basis.
All proxied traffic for one user will be logged to this file, differentiated
by client or server.  This file is opened at server startup, and is held open
until the server is shut down.

syslog_facility
---------------
The logging facility to be used for all syslog calls.  Any of the possible
facilities listed in the syslog(3C) manpage may be specified here except
for LOG_KERN.

syslog_prioritymask
-------------------
The syslog LOG_UPT() priority mask.  Read more about what this does in the
syslog(3C) manpage.  Any of the possible priorities specified in the
syslog(3C) manpage my be specified here.

send_tcp_keepalives
-------------------
Allows tcp keepalives to be enabled on all sockets if the tcp implementation
supports it.

tls_ca_file
-----------
File containing one or more Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.
See README.ssl for more information.

tls_ca_path
-----------
Path to directory with certificates of CAs.  This directory must have
filenames with the hashed value of the certificate (see openssl(1)).
See README.ssl for more information.

tls_cert_file
-------------
File containing the certificate presented by imapproxy to the server for
client authentication during STARTTLS.  See README.ssl for more information.

tls_key_file
------------
File containing the private key belonging to the client certificate.  See
README.ssl for more information.

##############################################################################
ADDITIONAL COMMANDS:
##############################################################################

There are a few additional commands that have been added to allow you to
administer the proxy server.  They're implemented through the same mechanism
as regular imap protocol commands, so they require you to telnet to your
proxy server on whatever port you choose to bind to and type them like a
regular protocol transaction.  At our site, we've severely limited access to
the proxy port such that only our webmail machines and one internal admin
machine can access it.  The proxy server software offers no way to limit the
usage of these commands by username.

P_NEWLOG
--------
Since the protocol log file is held open as long as the server is running,
it's difficult to clear the logfile.  This command was added to take care of
that for you.  It doesn't accept any arguments.

P_DUMPICC
---------
The Dump ICC command allows you to display the internal data structures of the
proxy server.  It can tell you how many connections you currently have open,
what users they're for, and the status of the connections (active or cached).
Use this sparingly if the proxy server is extremely busy.

P_TRACE
-------
This is used to turn on or off protocol logging.  If issued without any
arguments, it will disable protocol logging.  If issued with a username
argument, it will turn on logging for that particular user.  Protocol log
output will show up in the file configured as "protocol_log_filename" in the
configuration file.

P_RESETCOUNTERS
---------------
This allows you to reset the internal counters that pimpstat reports on
without having to restart the server.  These are the counters that are mmap()ed
to the file configured as "stat_filename" in the configuration file.


Happy proxying,
