0.19.3

* Made emphasis and strong regex's in WikiPage class ungreedy so as to stop unwanted behaviour.
- Removed looking for child object types as well when given a parent in wtf::loadObject. This was causing a problem of retrieving the child object when a child object had the same ID as the parent and it's the parent you are after. This slightly limits the flexibility of loadObject making supplying the class name of the object to return mandatory.
* Re-built distribution database backup, it is no longer just a dump of wtf.peej.co.uk and just includes the objects that are needed in a suitable state.
+ Added dumping of debug data to output upon terminal error.
+ Added base.xml to the distribution, is an XML representation of the distribution database backup for use with thingtool.php.

0.19.2

+ WikiPage object type added to base distribution. Inherits from the content class and handles Wiki regex's automagically by the objects view method and allows the storing of a comment about each update. Has it's view and edit permissions hard wired to the Eveyone group.
* Changed wtf.wikimenu.php to make create link point to wikipage create hardthing rather than the content create hardthing.
* Fixed bug in wtf.class.thing.php tidyArchive() that caused the incorrect number of archived version to be removed.

0.19.1

+ WORKSPACECREATE constant added selecting group allowed to create new Workspaces.
* Changed edit method of content class to display bad content in textarea upon save failure due to invalid XML rather than old valid content.
+ Added the placing of brackets around outputted character data in wtf.render.php when in debug mode. This allows you to see which sections of the character data are being processed as a single chunk.
* Fixed bug in user class create method, now uses newly created user to create home thing. 
* Fixed bug in user class delete method, now will still delete user thing even if home thing does not exist. 
* Altered loadObject static member function in wtf class to no longer return the Nothing Found object upon failure, now returns FALSE. This is due to the Nothing Found object being retrieved and having method executed upon by accident. The loadThing member function now loads the Nothing Found object when FALSE is recieved from loadObject. 
* Fixed bug in wtf::loadUser where only user class and not it's children were being looked for in the DB.
* Made change to search hardthing to do distinct select and include class name in result links.
* Changed content create method to call update function rather than preview function.
* Altered create methods for all objects to use $this for creation type if not called as static method.

0.19

* Major code re-write to use OO centered design. Underlying data structures changed totally, lots of major re-working of the execution flow. Major changes listed below:
* All items within the system are now objects that all inherit from the base "thing" object.
* All objects are now stored in a single DB table as serialized objects, loading and saving etc. handled by member functions of the base object.
* Separation of wtf.func.php into wtf.processcontent.php that handles processing instructions, wtf.render.php that handles output rendering, wtf.validate.php that handles XML validation, and wtf.func.php that contains misc functions.
+ System defaults file (wtf.defaults.php) added to set unset constants and variables from config file.
* Changed all POSIX compatible regexs to Perl compatible regexs for slight speed gain.
* Renamed quick linking to quick formatting since it does more than just creating links.
* Magic tags renamed to PPTags (pre-processed tags) and re-written to be more generic.
+ Universal processing instructions added to replace magic tags, allow adding of PIs to handle dynamic thing content (including the old PHP PI).
* Fixes to create and alter functions in MySQL database module.
* DBSelect changed to take concatination operator in where array.
+ Too much more to mention, this is really a total re-write using chunks of 0.18 code.

0.18

+ Added dependancy checking to wtf.func.php 
+ Re-organised base page (index.php) to exclude initialisation and termination code, extracted to wtf.func.php.
+ New function wtfDone in wtf.func.php
* Loading of menu items moved to Menu Module.
* Version const moved to wtf.func.php
* Chatbox re-written and moved into own module.
+ Private messages to users and usergroups added to chatbox.
* Format array changed to do array_merge on skin load so as to allow other tags defined in modules and separate from the skin. Will be overwritten if present in skin array.
* pageStartElement and pageEndElement in wtf.func.php tidied.
* Double quotes changed to single quotes to speed up execution where needed.
+ Added USEHOSTIPFORANONYMOUSUSER constant to wtf.config.php, if set true, WTF will use an anonymous users ip address as a username if USEHOSTNAMEFORANONYMOUSUSER is set to false. Useful for avoiding DNS lookups.
- Removed NothingFound function.
+ Added NothingFound tag to XML template.
+ Added safeStripSlashes function that takes the setting of magic quotes into account.
* Moved slash stripping to getValue function to make sure all input is stripped.
+ Quick Link processing added to Hard Things.

* Changed skin loading code in getUserDetails
* Fixed bug in sliceLongWords that truncated string.
* Changed entity escaping in validateContent so as not to expand ampersands in CDATA and PI's.
* Tidied gzip compression using PHP 4.0.4 ob_gzhandler function.
* Adjusted Thing XML to include author and updaters home Thing ID. Added to default skin also.
+ Added HARDTHINGAUTHOR, HARDTHINGHOMEID and HARDTHINGCREATED constants.
+ Added ANONYMOUSHOMEID constant.
+ Added PRELOADUSERSGROUPS and PRELOADTHINGSATTRIBUTES that when TRUE will load the users groups and the things attributes into the $user global and use $user rather than the DB in inGroup() and hasAttribute().
* Altered Info Hardthing to include homeid in info_creator/updator XML.
* Split format array into sections for each module. Each modules tags are stored inside that module but can be overwritten in the main format array .
