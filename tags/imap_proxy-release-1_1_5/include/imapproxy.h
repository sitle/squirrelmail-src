**
**      $Log: imapproxy.h,v $
**      Revision 1.9  2003/04/16 12:19:29  dgm
**      Added support for syslog configuration.
**      Added base64 routine prototypes that I previously forgot.
**
**      Revision 1.8  2003/03/19 13:24:50  dgm
**      Applied patch by Devrim Seral  <devrim@gazi.edu.tr> to allow
**      the default configfile to be configurable via a configure script.
**      (Lots of configures in that sentence, huh?)
**
**      Revision 1.7  2003/02/20 12:40:08  dgm
**      Added UNSELECT support.
**
**      Revision 1.6  2003/02/19 13:03:35  dgm
**      Added LITERAL_PASSWORD and NON_LITERAL_PASSWORD definitions.
**
**      Revision 1.5  2003/01/22 15:33:53  dgm
**      Changed Get_Server_sd() function prototype to reflect the addition of
**      the literal password flag.
**
**      Revision 1.4  2002/12/19 21:41:32  dgm
**      Added support for global configuration.
**
**      Revision 1.3  2002/08/30 13:21:42  dgm
**      Added total client logins counter to IMAPCounter struct
**
**      Revision 1.2  2002/08/29 16:33:46  dgm
**      Added CountTime field to struct IMAPCounter.
**      Removed #define for max number of open file descriptors since
**      we now determine rlimit dynamically instead.
**      Added POLL_TIMEOUT stuff.
**
**      Revision 1.1  2002/07/03 11:21:12  dgm
**      Initial revision
