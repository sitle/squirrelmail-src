**	$Log: imapcommon.c,v $
**	Revision 1.8  2003/01/27 13:59:53  dgm
**	Patch by Frode Nordahl <frode@powertech.no> to allow
**	compilation on Linux platforms.
**
**	Revision 1.7  2003/01/23 16:24:31  dgm
**	NonSyncLiteral flag was not being cleared properly.
**
**	Revision 1.6  2003/01/22 12:56:30  dgm
**	Changes to Get_Server_sd() so it can support login attempts where
**	the client sends the password as a string literal.
**
**	Revision 1.5  2002/12/18 14:39:55  dgm
**	Fixed bug in for loop for string literal processing.
**
**	Revision 1.4  2002/12/17 14:22:41  dgm
**	Added support for global configuration structure.
**
**	Revision 1.3  2002/08/29 20:22:12  dgm
**	Fixed nasty socket descriptor leak.
**
**	Revision 1.2  2002/08/28 15:57:49  dgm
**	replaced all internal log function calls with standard syslog calls.
**
**	Revision 1.1  2002/07/03 12:07:26  dgm
