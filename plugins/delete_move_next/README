deleteMoveNP -- Version 2.0
By Ben Brillat <brillat-sqplugin@mail.brillat.net>

This is a modified version of Delete Move Next by Bryan Stalcup <bryan@stalcup.net>

If you read the mail in your inbox starting with the most recent, this
plugin is meant for you. It adds a set of mail management links across 
the bottom or top of the email. 

Features
========
* Saves you the need to scroll up to go to the previous or next email
* Allows you to delete the current email and view the next or previous
  message in step
* Allows you to move the current email to any mailbox and view the next


Description
===========
The links include "Previous", "Next", and "Delete & Next", which deletes 
the current email and displays the next email. Also included is a menu 
to move the current email to any folder and then display the next email. 
It helps me keep up with my constantly overflowing inbox.

Future Work
===========
* You tell me...


Limitations
===========
If you delete or move an email, then use the "Message List" link at the
top left of the header, the message list is pulled from cache, and does
not reflect the deleted/moved email(s). To view the current list, click
the mailbox link in the left-hand navigation bar.

Installation
============
See the "INSTALL" file.
