NAME
	Framework for Object Orientated Development - FOOWD

VERSION
	0.8.4

AUTHOR:

DESCRIPTION
	Foowd is a framework for building object orientated (OO) web
	applications in PHP. It enables you to create and use persistent
	objects within your code, automating the process of keeping object
	state between code executions.
	
	As well as object persistency, Foowd acts as an object broker
	incorporating mechanisms for user authorisation, object security,
	input handling, making it quick and easy to build an OO web
	application.

INSTALLATION (quick):

	* Copy the files under the lib/ directory to a directory that is in
	  your PHP include_path, or set the FOOWD_DIR constant and put them in
	  this directory.

	* For each application using Foowd, create a MySQL database and use the
	  mysql.sql script to create the database table.
	  
SYNOPSIS:

	require("lib/env.foowd.php");

	$configArray = array(
		'db_type'=> 'mysql',
		'db_host'=> 'my_hostname',
		'db_database'=> 'my_database_name',
		'db_user' => 'my_user',
		'db_password' => 'my_password'
	);

	$foowd = new foowd($configArray);

	$obj =& $foowd->getObj(
		array('objectid' => 123456789)
	);

	$obj->set('title', 'A New Title');

	$obj->method('myMethod');

	$foowd->destroy();

REQUIREMENTS
	* PHP 4.2.0+ (tested with 4.3.1)
	* MySQL 3+ (tested with 3.23.28)
	* A web server with access to the above tools.

	Thanks go to Erin Schnabel for her tireless help with debugging and
