The Zookeeper documentation aims to explain what Zookeeper 
is, why it exists, and how it works.

<sect>Introduction
<p>
<nidx>zookeeper!introduction</nidx>
The Zookeeper documentation is a growing set of documents 
that will serve to explain to people what Zookeeper is, why 
it exists, and how it works.

<sect>What is Zookeeper?
<p>
<nidx>zookeeper!whatis</nidx>
Zookeeper is a set PHP libraries designed to be used in the 
constructions of web applications. These libraries provide 
flexible, abstract, and reusable components which form both 
high and low-level building blocks of web applications.

<sect1>History
<p>
Zookeeper is (sort of) a spinoff of the 
<htmlurl url="http://www.squirrelmail.org/" name="Squirrelmail"> 
project.  Squirrelmail was a major part of the ideas behind 
Zookeeper and (if all goes well) will be the first mainstream 
open source software project to make use of Zookeeper.

<sect1>Goals
<p>
The goal of this project is to provide an open source framework 
useful in building web applications with PHP. Zookeeper does 
this by through a variety of php libraries that can be utilized 
as the building blocks of any web application.

To put it simply, the purpose of Zookeeper is to make it easy 
for web applications to be written in PHP. It hopes to accomplish 
this in a couple different ways:

<itemize>
<item>By providing libraries of PHP code that make up the stuff 
that is regularly rewritten for each new web application that 
surfaces in the open source software world.
<item>By encouraging programming techniques that will help web 
application projects generally be more successful.
</itemize>

<sect1>Status
<p>
At this point, Zookeeper is still mostly an idea. Although 
development on Zookeeper is beginning with the help of some of 
the folks from the Squirrelmail project, Zookeeper is still 
pre-alpha in nature. 


<sect>Architecture
<p>
<nidx>zookeeper!architecture</nidx>
Put something here about design patterns, services/modules, 
oop/classes, and layout of ZK.

<sect1>Design Patterns
<p>
There's a book called 
<htmlurl url="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/ref%3Dbxgy%5Fsr%5Ftext%5Fa/002-0382226-3137646" name="Design Patterns">
for sale at 
<htmlurl url="http://www.amazon.com/" name="amazon.com">.

<sect2>The Bridge design pattern
<p>
See <htmlurl url="http://rampages.onramp.net/~huston/dp/bridge.html">

<sect2>Other design patterns
<p>
This section will require some research.  

<sect1>Services and Modules
<p>
Following the principle of the Bridge design pattern, each <em>service</em> 
that Zookeeper provides will be implemented by one or more <em>modules</em>.  

A <em>service</em> is a front-end API that the web application will 
use to interface with Zookeeper.  

For example, a web mail application might use a "session" service to 
store users' session data.  

A <em>module</em> is backend-end code that will perform the functions 
of a <em>service</em>.  Abstracting the code that is actually performing 
the functions of a <em>service</em> allows for greater flexibility.  

For example, the a "session" service could use a "MySQL" module, a 
"PostgreSQL" module, or a "flat files" module.  

<sect1>Object Oriented Programming
<p>
To achieve flexibility and encapsulation, Zookeeper will be object-oriented.  

<sect1>Zookeeper's Layout
<p>
Something about directory structure here would be helpful.
