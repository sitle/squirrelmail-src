All about this Release!!!
=========================

  The big news. The PHP community has decided to change
the default configuration of PHP to not use the sometimes dangerous
register_globals directive. Since SquirrelMail relied on that
setting we decided to convert the SquirrelMail code to work
without it. So starting with this release SquirrelMail will
now work with register_globals set to on or off. All the plugins
that come with SquirrelMail have been converted as well. However
plugins that you can download from here:

http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugins.php

may not be updated yet to work without register_globals. If your
must have plugin has not been updated yet you can still run with
register_globals enabled until it has.

  What else is new with 1.2.8? Bug fixes. Lots and lots of bugfixes.
From multipart message and attachment handling to HTML code cleanup
many of the most prominent bugs from 1.2.7 or earlier have been fixed.

See the Changelog file for details of this release.

   Being one of the most popular webmail clients, the developers of
SquirrelMail feel a huge desire and responsibility to continue push
the envelope and make SquirrelMail the best it can possibly be. Here
is an incomplete list of some of the great features that Squirrelmail
has to offer:

  * Collapsible Folders - The folder list can be collapsed at any
          parent folder. This makes folder lists with large
          hierarchical structures much easier to manage and navigate.
  * The Paginator! - This enables quick access to any page in the
          message list by simply choosing the page number to view
          rather than tediously clicking "next" 50 times.
  * Drafts - It is now possible to compose a message and save it to
          be sent at a later date with the drafts option.
  * Ability to mark messages as read and unread from the message listing.
  * Multiple Identities - It is now possible to create different
          identities (home, work, school) that can be chosen upon
          sending. Each identity can have its own email address,
          full name, and signature.
  * Ability to forward messages as attachments from the message listing.
  * Reply Citations - Different types of citations are now possible
          when replying to messages.
  * Server-side sorting support adds speed to the mailbox display, even
          with large mailboxes. Server-sid thread sorting support allows 
          users to display mailboxes in thread-sort order.

  
I am sure there are plenty more features I have missed. You just have
to try it for yourself!

Having been involved with Squirrelmail for a while I can safely say
that this stable release has the most bugfixes to date. The invaluable
contributions of the Squirrelmail community, from developers and users
alike have helped to make this release of Squirrelmail the best yet.

Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.2 bug
==========================================

Of course, in the words of Linus Torvalds, this release is officially
certified to be Bug-Free (tm).

However, if for some reason some bugs manage to find their way to the
surface, please report them at once (after all, they ARE uncertified
bugs!!!) The PROPER place to report these bugs is the SquirrelMail Bug
Tracker.

   http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs

Thank you for your cooperation in that issue. That helps us to make
sure that nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.


Important Note about PHP versions
==============================

PHP Versions have changed in many ways from the 4.0.X series to the 
current 4.2.2 release. While it is always recommended to be running
the latest stable release of PHP we realize that may not be under
your control. So while converting SquirrelMail to work without
register_globals we were careful to test with a wide variety of
PHP versions. The current recommended PHP versions for SquirrelMail
are PHP 4.0.6 through 4.2.2. Versions earlier than 4.0.6 are known to
work, as well as development PHP version but they are not considered
the ideal versions for SquirrelMail. 


About our Release Aliases - By Jason Munro
=========================

  A spate of recently reported squirrel deaths has prompted the 
SquirrelMail developers to ponder, "What can we do to protect our
much loved mascot from this unfortunate demise?" Nothing really,
except honor the squirrel name with the best SquirrelMail release
to date and a release alias that strikes fear in the heart of
reckless drivers everywhere, 'Roadkill Revenge'.

                  Happy SquirrelMailing!
