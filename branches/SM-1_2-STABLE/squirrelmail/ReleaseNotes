All about this Release!!!
=========================

   This release brings some security fixes, and some session fixes
releated to double logins of 1.2.10.  Combined with those, we hope
we have managed to get some of the other noticable bugs in the
1.2.10 release.

   You'll not find nifty new features in this release because we're
maintaining it only. Meanwhile, we are working on stabilizing the
already quite stable development branch, which comes with loads
of enhancements and improvements! We hope to present you with the
shiny new 1.4 series Any Time Soon[tm].

See the Changelog file for details of this release.

   Being one of the most popular webmail clients, the developers of
SquirrelMail feel a huge desire and responsibility to continue push
the envelope and make SquirrelMail the best it can possibly be. Here
is an incomplete list of some of the great features that Squirrelmail
has to offer:

  * Collapsible Folders - The folder list can be collapsed at any
          parent folder. This makes folder lists with large
          hierarchical structures much easier to manage and navigate.
  * The Paginator! - This enables quick access to any page in the
          message list by simply choosing the page number to view
          rather than tediously clicking "next" 50 times.
  * Drafts - It is now possible to compose a message and save it to
          be sent at a later date with the drafts option.
  * Ability to mark messages as read and unread from the message listing.
  * Multiple Identities - It is now possible to create different
          identities (home, work, school) that can be chosen upon
          sending. Each identity can have its own email address,
          full name, and signature.
  * Ability to forward messages as attachments from the message listing.
  * Reply Citations - Different types of citations are now possible
          when replying to messages.
  * Server-side sorting support adds speed to the mailbox display, even
          with large mailboxes. Server-sid thread sorting support allows 
          users to display mailboxes in thread-sort order.

  
I am sure there are plenty more features I have missed. You just have
to try it for yourself!

Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.2 bug
==========================================

Of course, in the words of Linus Torvalds, this release is officially
certified to be Bug-Free (tm).

However, if for some reason some bugs manage to find their way to the
surface, please report them at once (after all, they ARE uncertified
bugs!!!) The PROPER place to report these bugs is the SquirrelMail Bug
Tracker.

   http://www.squirrelmail.org/bugs

Thank you for your cooperation in that issue. That helps us to make
sure that nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.


Important Note about PHP versions
=================================

PHP Versions have changed in many ways from the 4.0.X series to the 
current 4.2.3 release. While it is always recommended to be running
the latest stable release of PHP we realize that may not be under
your control. So while converting SquirrelMail to work without
register_globals we were careful to test with a wide variety of
PHP versions. The current recommended PHP versions for SquirrelMail
are PHP 4.0.6 through 4.2.3. Versions earlier than 4.0.6 are known to
work, as well as development PHP version but they are not considered
the ideal versions for SquirrelMail. 


About our Release Aliases - By Jonathan Angliss
=========================

Because we've been working hard on the 1.4 stable release, the
security enhancements has brought a few confused minds into the camp.
Chris suggested that it's all a bunch of Mixed Nuts, with the bug
fixing, and testing of both stable versions.


                  Happy SquirrelMailing!
