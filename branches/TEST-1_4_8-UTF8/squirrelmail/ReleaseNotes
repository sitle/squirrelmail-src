All about this release
======================

This version, 1.4.8.utf8-1 is a experimental release, that switches
all translations to utf-8 and removes some hacks specific only to 
Japanese translation.

WARNING: Minimal PHP requirements are increased in this SquirrelMail
version. PHP mbstring extension is required. Interface won't display
errors, if mbstring extension is missing, but 8bit email headers and
IMAP folder names will be broken. Please test your configuration with
included configtest.php utility and make sure that you pass all tests.

Locales / Translations / Charsets
=================================

This SquirrelMail release loads language definitions from 
locale/*/setup.php files. Only US English translation is enabled by 
default. If other translations are not available, language options 
are not visible in Display Preferences. This release can use standard 
1.4.8 translation packages or 1.4.8.utf8 translation packages. Use of 
1.4.8.utf8 translations is strongly recommended.

Due to changes in character set decoding, this package should use
special extra decoding library version. Standard squirrelmail_decode 
1.1 scripts might have issues in Japanese translation.


A note on plugins
=================

All plugins that store their translations in own locale directory or
use non-standard translation method, must convert translation files
to utf-8. Gettext translations can be converted with gettext msgconv
utility. Other translations can be converted with recode, iconv or
some other character set conversion utility.


About release name
==================

This SquirrelMail release is labeled "Solidarnost". 26 years ago
Polish shipyard workers started strike actions in Gdansk. Workers
have founded "Solidarnost" trade union. In the 1980s union 
constituted a broad anti-communist social movement. In 1989 
"Solidarnost" delegates won elections in Poland and their 
leader Lech Valesa was elected president.


Reporting my favorite SquirrelMail 1.4 bug
==========================================

We constantly aim to make SquirrelMail even better. So we need you to
submit any bug you come across! Also, please mention that the bug is
in this release, and list your IMAP server and webserver details.

Thanks for your cooperation with this. That helps us to make
sure nothing slips through the cracks. Also, it would help if
people would check existing tracker items for a bug before reporting
it again. This would help to eliminate duplicate reports, and
increase the time we can spend CODING by DECREASING the time we
spend sorting through bug reports. And remember, check not only OPEN
bug reports, but also closed ones as a bug that you report MAY have
been fixed in CVS already.
