"dspam is a learning system that filters spam based on what <i>you</i> tell "
"it is spam and what isn't. Messages are analyzed as they are delivered and "
"are assigned a spam probability between 0 and 1. The more messages you "
"receive, both spam and innocent, the better dspam learns what <i>you</i> "
"think is spam and what is not."
