The 1.3 Development Branch:
---------------------------

This branch has been created to allow the developers of SquirrelMail to play
with ideas that are a little too cutting edge (and likely to break things)
to allow them to be added to the current 'Stable' 1.2 branch.

This is envisioned to be an intermediate stage in which we can experiment with
things that will later be implemented in Zookeeper.
