MULTIUSER
=========
1. Using this plugin with multi-user environments can cause a bloated $attachment_dir.

	This possiblity stems from using the attachment dir as a place to temporarily
	store the upload file while we rearrange it. Hey, I have to put it somewhere!
	Actually, the real problem is that users may tend to bail out of the whole
	thing before they are finished. If they do the temp file is never unlinked.
	Any suggestions as to how to solve this are welcome.

GENERAL USE
===========
1. Importing is a one step arrangment process when > 10 or 15 fields are used.

	I haven't been to worried about fixing this because noone uses this plugin.
	What happens is that if someone wants to import 20 fields into the 5 existing
	fields they can only import how many are available as input text boxes. I could
	change this dynamically to suit the number of importable fields. Originally it
	did this. The result was so ugly I changed it back. Anyway, after the fields are
	rearranged, the fields in excess of field 5 get field with 5's data. Again, not
	real big on fixing this until a bunch of people complain.

2. Sanity checks

	There are not a ton of error checks in here. We don't output nicely formatted
	error messages if youy decide to try and import non-csv files or if other
	common stupid user tricks are performed. Hey, I just wrote it. I have never
	used it myself other than to check if it works. If someone wants to code a
	bunch of checks I'll gladly include them.

3. Security

	Haven't done a lot of testing but I guess it is possible for someone to upload
	random code and then execute it. The tempfile name is made psuedo random by the
	addition of the system time and a variable name so I don't imagine it would be
	easy. Still, I thought you should know. The script should fail if the file
	doesn't contain CSV formatted text so I can't imagine what harm they could do.
