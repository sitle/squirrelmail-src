focus_change Plugin
-------------------

This simply makes the "Username" field on the login screen have focus
by default.  This uses javascript, so it was put into a plugin to keep
us free from Javascript.

To Install:
-----------
  1. Unarchive the file (which I assume you've already done)
      $ cd plugins
      $ tar -zxvf focus_change-0.1.tar.gz

  2. Run conf.pl, choose "8" from the main menu, and add "focus_change"
     as a new plugin.  Save and exit.

  3. Done
