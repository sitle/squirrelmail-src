Password Forget -- Version 1.2

Some browsers allow the user to save the username and password when
submitting various forms on the web.  Some admins don't like that.
This tries to help avoid that nasty situation.


Features
========

* Provides semi-random username and password form entry variables
* Stops browsers from caching the username and password
* Good for places with lots of public-access computers


Description
===========

IE 5 and Mozilla 6 both enable the user to have the browser keep track of
all usernames and passwords used.  Used with an evil intent, a person
could turn on this feature, walk away from a public-access computer, and
come back later after people have checked their mail.  By simply typing a
letter or two of the username, the username will pop up.  When the username
pops up, the password will get filled in.  The evil person could do whatever
they wanted with the victim's mail account.


Future Work
===========

Installation
============

As with other plugins, just uncompress the archive in the plugins
directory, go back to the main directory, run configure and add the plugin.
