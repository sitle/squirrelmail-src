Mail Fetch -- Version 0.3

Downloads mail from a pop3 server to your SquirrelMail account.

Features
========

* Copies messages from remote server
* Saves server, username, and password in prefs file...
* Remembers where to resume downloading messages if 
    your pop server supports UIDL.
* Optionally deletes mail from the remote server.

Description
===========

Feel like grabbing your messages from a different mail server into
SquirrelMail?  This might be able to help.


Configuration
=============

Under the options menu you can configure your server, 
username, and password. Make sure "Leave Mail On Server" is checked if you
do not want Mail_Fetch to delete it from the remote server. Once configured,
click 'Fetch' in the SquirrelMail menu to get your mail.


Future Work
===========

* Allow an infinite amount of remote servers
* Add IMAP server stealing
* Option to not save password - prompt on check
* Check remote servers on SM startup
* Save messages into a local IMAP folder instead of INBOX


Installation
============

As with other plugins, just uncompress the archive in the plugins
directory, go back to the main directory, run configure and add the plugin.
