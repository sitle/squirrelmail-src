Email Forwarding plugin for SquirrelMail

The Options for Email forwarding is 'plugged'
into the Personal Options page.

You must copy the wfwd program to /usr/sbin as
this is the program the setup script calls
when you save the options.

You can change the location but you must then
modify the setup script as well.
