SquirrelSpell-v0.3
--------------------

Untar SquirrelSpell into your squirrelmail/plugins directory. Modify the
sqspell_config.php file making sure you have ispell or aspell available on 
your system and located in PHP's path. The squirrelspell doesn't check for 
that and if it is not available, you're just going to get a "No errors found" 
message every time. :) Quite pleasing, but not very useful.

Read files in "doc" directory -- they explain some features.

Enable the plugin either by hand or by running the configure script from
your squirrelmail install directory.

Enjoy and report bugs. ;)
