This is the history for the newmail plugin in SquirrelMail.  Currently
works with the 0.5+ versions of SquirrelMail.

1.3a

Hm. Apparently the Sent box is being used to indicate new mail when
checking all folders.  Disabled this.  Ditto for the Trash folder
as well.

Changed the plugin name to "newmail", seeing that it really is more
than just a sound plugin ;)


1.3

Now added the ability to only check for RECENT messages (those that
have not had their information not yet looked at).  Once a message
is "noticed", it will not show up again as recent.  Nice for
people who want to limit the number of notifications.

Also changed the popup from a javascript alert to a popup window.
This way, it doesn't screw up the browser near as much.

Finally, I added a new sub-directory called sounds.  Put in here
any sounds you want users to choose from.  They now can choose
from any file in that directory via a drop-down menu in the options 
screen (or, they can still choose a local file).

1.2

Added the ability to show a popup window on new mail arrival (via a
JavaScript function).

Added the ability to check for ONLY the INBOX for unseen messages
(the default).  Also fixed a bug in counting unseen messages. ;)

1.1

Now added the ability to turn off this feature for users who don't want
it.  The default is NOT enabled, so you need to go to the options menu to
turn it on.

Also a nice way to reset the file back to the server default.

1.0

First release (with an option page)!

0.9

First pass-through of making a plugin.  Hack hack hack . . .
