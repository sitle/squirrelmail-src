VERSION
	0.8.2

DESCRIPTION
	FOOWD is a framework for building object orientated (OO) web applications
	in PHP. It is a collection of base classes ripe for extending that handle
	object persistency, user authorisation, security, data administration,
	input handling, all the things required to build OO web applications.

DOCUMENTATION
	The beginnings of a FOOWD manual can be found at http://foowd.peej.co.uk/

REQUIREMENTS
	* PHP 4.2.0+ (tested with 4.3.1)
	* MySQL 3+ (tested with 3.23.28)
	* A web server with access to the above tools.

FLATFILE INSTALLATION (Quick and Dirty)
	* Extract the archive somewhere into the web root of your web server keeping
	the directory structure in tact, the archive will create a directory called
	"foowd".
	* Fire up a web browser and navigate to your new site.
	* Enjoy.
	
MYSQL INSTALLATION (Full and Proper)
	* Extract the archive somewhere into the web root of your web server keeping
	the directory structure in tact, the archive will create a directory called
	"foowd".
	* Connect to your MySQL server using your favourite client with a user with
	the appropriate privileges and either create yourself a new database or use
	an existing one you already have lying around ready. Use the database creation
	script mysql.sql to create the FOOWD table tlbObject and populate it with the
	initial data. Note: To get full functionality your database user will require
	the following privileges: Select, Insert, Update, Delete, Index, Alter.
	* Make a copy of config.default.php and open it in your favourite PHP editor.
	Set the database server hostname, etc. and change constant DATABASE to 'mysql'.
	Save the file.
	* Open the lead-in document, index.php. Change the second line to point to
	your new config.
	* Fire up a web browser and navigate to your new site. Use the menu at the
	foot of the page to log in with the username 'root' giving the password 'root'.
	Click on 'Root' on the menu at the foot of the page, then on the 'Update'
	method. This will display the user update form and allow you to change the
	password. Once changed you will be required to log in again with the new password.
	* Enjoy.
