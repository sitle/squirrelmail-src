NAME
	WTF - Wiki Type Framework

VERSION
	0.19.3

DESCRIPTION
	WTF is not a Wiki engine, although it can be used as one. It is
	actually a generic web content management engine allowing you to create
	web documents easily from the comfort of your browser. If you must
	compare it to something, consider it a cross between a Blog, a Wiki,
	and a forum.

DOCUMENTATION
	There is currently no system documentation apart from the files located
	within this archive.

REQUIREMENTS
	* PHP 4.0.4+ (tested with 4.2.1)
	* MySQL 3+ (tested with 3.23.28)
	* A web server (duh) with access to the above tools.
	
INSTALLATION
	* Extract the archive to your web directory. If you are overwriting an old
	installation, make sure you backup your wtf.config.php and index.php files
	if you want to keep them.
	* Edit index.php to adjust the PATH constant so as to point to the location
	of wtf.config.php.
	* Edit wtf.config.php to set the database connection constants and the URI
	settings.
	* Use mysql.sql to build the required table structure (additional fields
	will need to be added to this table by the code so make sure the user has
	permission to ALTER tables within this database) and create the initial
	data.
	* Fire up your web browser, hit the server and log in as "root" with the
	default password of "root". Then hit edit to change your root password
	to something a little more secure.
	* Enjoy.
