given mail stream. criteria is a string, delimited by spaces, in which 
the following keywords are allowed. Any multi-word arguments 
(eg. FROM "joey smith") must be quoted.

If $charset is specified, make the search happen in that charset (if possible).
However, default is to not specify the charset.

For example, to match all unanswered messages sent by Mom, you'd use: 
"UNANSWERED FROM mom". Searches appear to be case insensitive. This list 
of criteria is from a reading of the UW c-client source code and may be 
uncomplete or inaccurate (see also RFC2060, section 6.4.4).

<b>Returns:</b><br><br>

An array of message id numbers that fit the criteria specified if successful.
An empty array if no messages were found.
If an error occurred, an instance of the Error class with the appropriate
error number set will be returned and the <tt>$this-&gt;error</tt> variable will be set.
